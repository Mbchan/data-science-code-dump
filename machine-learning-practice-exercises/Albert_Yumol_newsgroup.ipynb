I claim that since\\nGretzky\\'s arrival they have at the very least been competitive...I also claim\\nthat McNall has made a stupid move in trying to reassemble the Oiler\\ndynasty...but that\\'s another story and included only because I don\\'t like\\nMcNall:-).  Anyway,  McNall did do some heavy marketing around Gretzky, and\\nthat undoubtedly was also responsible for the attendance and merchandising\\nsales, etc.  But as I said, when the Kings have been in there little\\ntailspins over the past couple of years there have been empty seats at the\\nForum even if the tickets were sold.\\n\\n\\nFor the short term, IMO.  Although I think that it\\'s inevitable that the team\\nwill improve with a player such as Lemieux or Gretzky, simply because they\\nmake people around them better.\\n\\n\\nWell, at least we are in full agreement here!\\n\\n\\nSo are you saying Roger has ever had a valid point? <couldn\\'t resist...>\\n\\n\\nYes, but they are doing no worse than last year.  I think the same type of\\nreasoning I applied to a new Pittsburgh fan applies to all the extra people\\nshowing up at Winnipeg games.  It\\'s difficult to predict, but do you think\\nthat if the Jets miss the playoffs next season that in the year after they\\nwill maintain their attendance levels?  I seriously doubt it, because in that\\ncase the expectation of an improving team would be gone, with or without\\nSelanne.',\n",

Foul (Any illegal contact with the other player or his stick with your\\n   body or stick). If you get 5 you are out for the game.\\n\\n2. Unsportsmanlike contact. (An intentional foul). This inlcludes all the\\n   current flavours of roughing, fighting and boarding. If you get two you\\n   are thrown out of the game, and fined.\\n\\n3. Technical foul. Bad mouthing the ref, by player or coach. Penalty shot\\n   is awarded. Two and you are thrown out of the game.\\n\\nBesides the penalty shot for one technical, if the team gets 5 penalties\\nin a period, the opposing team gets a penalty shot for every additional one,\\nuntil the end of the period. The victim gets two shots if he/she was in\\nthe act of shooting when the foul ocured.\\n\\nThis works well for several reasons. First, penalty shots are the most\\nexciting thing in hockey, right? So, it follows that the more the better.\\nNext, when the player is setting up for a penalty shot, the network can\\ntake a commercial. Finally, with only three penalties, the network\\nannouncers (Don Meredith, Dick Vitale, John Madden, Pat Summerall, and\\nMarv Levy, among others) will be able to tell the viewers what happened before\\nthe PA announcer says it.\\n\\nOh, one other rule. When a goal is scored (10-20 times a period), the play\\ncannot resume until the PA announcer announces it. This way, the network\\ncan sneak in a few more commercials. Then, once the PA announcer has told\\nthem who scored, the TV announcer can tell you the viewer, and even have a \\nchance of pronouncing his name right.\\n\\nSeriously, though, I actually went to see a NBA basketball game last week,\\nfor the first time in my life. I was amazed how boring it was. The play is\\nso slow they actually had fans come out for things like free-throw shooting\\ncontests DURING THE PERIOD!. Of course the 'Laker Girls' get to do their \\nroutines at least 6-8 times during the game, and not just between periods\\neither. There is a whistle every 30 seconds on average, maybe less. The\\ngame is 48 minutes, with 2 minutes between quarters 1-2 and 3-4 and a\\n10 minute halftime, and it still takes over 2 hours.\\n\\nThe reason for this has to be TV. There is plenty of room to throw in\\ncommercials, and have the announcer jabber while nothing else is happening.\\nOn TV, basketball is fairly entertaining, IMHO. But, it is better to watch\\nit on TV than to be there. If this is the road the NHL is following, then\\nit truly is a sad day.\\n\\nEnough for now.\",\n",

A strike by public workers has forced the\\nleafs out of the Newfoundland city for much of the last half of\\nthe seaosn (since mid-Jan). They have played \"home\" games in places\\nlike Montreal, Cornwall and Charlottetown. Their playoff \"home\"\\ngames will be played in the Metro Center in Halifax, NS. One\\ndemostration got violent. Workers attacked a Leafs\\' bus and\\nrocked it and broke windows in the St John\\'s Memorial Stadium.\\nDespite the problems, Toronto officials insist that the Leafs\\nwill return to St John\\'s once the strike ends.\\n===================================================\\nSENATORS SOLD\\nThe New Haven Senators have been sold by Peter Shipman to\\nthe Ottawa Senators NHL organization. They are the only Canadian\\nNHL team with an American AHL affiliate, and have made it clear\\nthey intend to move the team to somewhere in the Canadian Atlantic\\nProvinces. This sale and move has yet to be approved by the AHL\\nhead office, but is expected to pass easily at the general meeting\\nin May. The quote in the story from Jack Butterfield made it \\nclear the league was more interested in the stability of the \\nAHL franchise accompanied by NHL ownership, rather than maintaining\\nthe 56-year history of the AHL in New Haven. \\n\\nThe Senators are currently in serious negotiations with Charlottetown\\nNew Brunswick and are expected to move there.\\n==================================================\\nDALLAS HELPS HAWKS STAY IN MONCTON\\nAfter announcing that they would pull their affiliation out\\nof Moncton, the Winnipeg Jets changed their mind. \\n\\nThe Jets announced the move when they said that they would be slashing\\ntheir minor league roster from 20-something to around a dozen; and they\\nwanted to share with an existing AHL or IHL franchise.\\n\\nEnter the Dallas Lone Stars. Dallas agreed to supply the remaining\\n6 or 8 players to the Moncton franchise. Thus keeping the Hawks\\nin the New Brunswick city.\\n\\nThe deal is for one year and will be extended to three years if\\nthe season ticket base increases to over 3000. The Hawks only sold\\n1400 for this year.\\n============================================================\\nSAINT JOHN FLAMES OFFICIAL\\nThe Calgary Flames have officially signed a deal with the city of\\nSaint John, NB. The Saint John Blue Flames will play in the 6200\\nExhibition Center. The Flames still have to apply for an expansion\\nfrnachise from the AHL but are expected to have no trouble.\\n=========================================================\\nCAPS FOLLOW JACKS TO MAINE\\nDespite rumors to the contrary, the Capitals will follow the Baltimore\\nSkipjacks to Maine. The Caps\\' current farm team, the Baltimore Skipjacks,\\nannounced that they would move to Maine and become the Portland Pirates.\\nThere was much doubt as to if the Caps would follow but they announced\\na limited deal with Portland. They would supply a dozen or so players\\nincluding 2 goalies. They become the third team to announce a limited\\nfarm team along with Moncton and the Capital District Islanders.\\n======================================================\\nAHL GAME OF THE WEEK\\nIn early January, the AHL started a game of the week. The game, produced\\nby, I believe, Pyman Productions, was televised across the Canadian\\nMaritimes and northeastern US. The first few weeks saw two games of\\nthe week, one in Canada and another in the US but since then, there\\nhas been only one.

Again CAVEAT EMPTOR, some mail order companies DO\\ninclude sales tax on purchases even if they are out of state, so check!',\n",

It\\'s\\nan honor for me to welcome the University of Maine Black Bears, the\\nwinner of the NCAA Division I hockey national championship to the\\nRose Garden and the White House.  I understand from Senator Mitchell\\nthat this is the first team from the University of Maine every to win\\na national championship.  And we\\'re glad to have them here.\\n\\n     I\\'m inspired not only by how the team pulled together to\\nwin the championship, but how the entire state pulled together to\\ncheer them onto victory.\\n\\n     Coming from a state that is also relatively small in\\nsize, but also filled with pride and tradition and community, I can\\nunderstand how the people of Maine must feel about the Black Bears.\\nIn our state people are still talking about the time we won the\\nOrange Bowl over the number one ranked football team, and that was\\nback in 1978.  I\\'m sure that 15 years from now, the people of Maine\\nwill as proud of this team as they are today.\\n\\n     You know, in my state football is a slightly more\\npopular sport than hockey.  We don\\'t have a lot of ice.  (Laughter.)\\nBut after spending three months getting banged around in this town, I\\ncan understand a little more about hockey than I did before I came\\nhere.  Hockey is a tough game.  It\\'s a hard-hitting sport.  It does\\nhave one virtue though, there\\'s a penalty for delay of game.  I wish\\nwe had that rule in the Senate.  (Laughter.)\\n\\n     In government as in hockey, leadership is important.  In\\nthe United States Senate, our team has a great captain, the Majority\\nLeader and the senior Senator from Maine, George Mitchell; junior\\nSenator -- Cohen looks so young, I can\\'t imagine.  (Laughter.)  I\\'m\\nactually bitter about Senator Cohen because he looks so much younger\\nthan me.\\n\\n     On your hockey team, the captain Jim Montgomery has done\\na great job.  He scored the winning goal late in the championship\\ngame, leading you to a come-from-behind victory -- something else I\\nknow a little bit about.\\n\\n     Sport brings out the best in individuals and in teams\\nand in communities.  I share the pride that Senator Mitchell and\\nSenator Cohen and Congressman Andrews and all the people of Maine\\nmust feel for the Black Bears who have shown us all how to play as a\\nteam, how to bring out the best in one another, and how to come from\\nbehind.\\n\\n     I think it\\'s important, as I ask young people from\\naround America who have achieved outstanding things in working\\ntogether, to come here to the White House to be recognized and\\nappreciated by their country, to remember that those kinds of values\\nand those kinds of virtues need to be ingrained in all of us for all\\nof our lives.\\n\\n     We now have another role model, and I\\'m glad to have\\nthem here today.

We only had about five minutes to\\ntalk.  And we agreed we\\'d get back together later, around noon, and\\ntalk some more.\\n\\n     Q  Senator Dole said over the weekend that your\\ncompromise is no compromise.\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I know he did, but, look, Senator\\nDole and a lot of the other Republicans now in the Senate voted for\\nthe same kind of thing for Ronald Reagan in 1983; and our research\\nindicates that a majority of them over time voted for a total of 28\\nemergency spending measures totalling over $100 billion when Reagan\\nand Bush were President, in those administrations.  And many of those\\npurposes were not nearly as worthy as putting the American people\\nback to work.  I don\\'t want to go back and revisit every one, but you\\n\\n\\ncan do it.  You can look at the research there.  So this position\\nthey\\'re taking is not credible.  We have a very tough five-year\\ndeficit reduction plan.  All these costs are covered during that time\\nand then some.  And the very people that are saying this has all got\\nto be paid for don\\'t have much of a history on which to base their\\nposition.  They\\'ve got 12 years of vote for stimulus measures of this\\nkind that had very little to with putting the American people back to\\nwork.  So I think we\\'ve got a chance to work it out, and I\\'m hopeful.\\nWe\\'ll see what happens today and tomorrow.

       " 'The FLYERS blew a 3-0 lead over the Buffalo Sabres in the second period, but\\nKevin Dineen\\'s 7th career hat trick powered them to their 7th consecutive win,\\n7-4 over the Sabres who have now lost 7 in a row. Alexander Mogilny led the\\ncomeback scoring his 75th and 76th goals of the season which tied the game at\\n3 in the 2nd period and 4 in the 3rd. Tommy Soderstrom stopped 41 of 45 shots\\non goal to improve his own record to 20-17-6 as he was tested by Mogilny and\\nLaFontaine all night.\\n\\nRoster move:\\n\\nAndre Faust was once again recalled from Hershey, Shawn Cronin was a healthy\\nscratch.\\n\\nLines:\\n\\nEklund-Lindros-Recchi\\nBeranek-Brind\\'Amour-Dineen\\nLomakin-Butsayev-Conroy\\nFaust-Acton-Brown\\n\\nGalley-Bowen\\nYushkevich-Hawgood\\nCarkner-McGill\\n\\nTommy Soderstrom\\n\\nGame Summary:\\n\\nSay, if anybody from Buffalo is reading this, where did you people get that\\nwoman who sang the anthems? We had to turn down the volume!\\n\\nThe FLYERS defense started out the game showing everybody why the FLYERS have\\nbeen shutting teams out lately by holding the Sabres to only 8 shots in the\\nfirst period. They then showed everybody why they will be playing golf Sunday\\nwhen they gave up 37 shots in the last two periods. Maybe Tommy told them that\\nhe was getting bored back there...\\n\\nMark Recchi opened the scoring so fast that if you blinked you missed it. After\\nBuffalo won the faceoff and dumped, Tommy wrapped the puck around the boards\\nto Eric 1/2 way up on his left. Eric dropped it to Galley, and he sent it ahead\\nto Recchi steaming out of the zone. Mark skated into the center circle, passed\\nthe puck to himself through the legs of Richard Smehlik, skated around him and\\nin on Fuhr. Smehlik was pulling at him all the way through the zone with his\\nstick, Recchi drifted right, drifted back left, and slid the puck back to the\\nright past Fuhr for a 1-0 FLYERS lead at 0:18. It was so beautiful Eric and\\nGarry should turn down their assists :-).\\n\\nThe FLYERS kept the pressure on Fuhr for a while after that, but he was strong\\nand kept the FLYERS from doing further damage. The game then became a defensive\\nstruggle for a while. The Sabres got the first chance on the power play when\\nTerry Carkner took a boarding minor at 10:26 for crunching Dale Hawerchuk into\\nthe boards in the FLYERS zone. LaFontaine got the only scoring chance, and not\\na terribly good one, as the FLYERS smothered the Sabres power play. Mogilny got\\na post after it was over. The 25th consecutive penalty kill for the FLYERS.\\n\\nKeith Carney took a holding penalty at 13:31 for taking down Mark Recchi to\\ngive the FLYERS a power play. The best penalty killing team in the league\\ndidn\\'t allow the FLYERS a shot on goal, although the FLYERS did create a\\ngood scoring chance for Lindros who partially fanned on his shot. Towards\\nthe end of the period the play started going end to end, but everybody kept\\nmissing the net. Greg Hawgood took an interference penalty at 18:19 to give\\nthe Sabres another power play, but they couldn\\'t get anything going and the\\nfans expressed their displeasure, particularly when they iced the puck. Shots\\nwere 8-6 Buffalo after the FLYERS had led 6-2 at one point.\\n\\nMike Emrick interviewed FLYERS president Jay Snider between periods. Jay was\\ndisappointed to not make the playoffs, but not discouraged. This was considered\\na rebuilding year after *The Trade* and he seemed very happy with the way the\\nseason went. When asked if he agonized over *The Trade* he said that it was\\nRuss Farwell\\'s trade and not his, that it only was an issue for him and Ed\\nSnider as far as the money. But yes, there was some agonizing, and they\\'d do\\nit all over again. When asked how the coaching situation would be handled for\\nnext year he said that it\\'s Russ\\' call, and Russ will evaluate things at the\\nend of the season. He feels that they\\'re 3 years away from a shot at the Cup.\\nHe expects to get into the playoffs next year, have a shot at a division title\\nthe following year, and a shot at the finals the year after that. This based\\non the current level of play and anticipated improvements over the summer.\\n\\nHe\\'s very happy with the re-alignment (he called it \"outstanding\"). Happy with\\nthe current expansion, feels that the talent pool is big enough with the unflux\\nof Europeans, but feels that they must make sure existing franchises are stable.\\nSeemed to like the idea of playing in the Olympics (booo) but said that there\\nwas a definite split among owners and that this certainly would only happen in\\nfour years if there was a consensus.\\n\\nThe Sabres gave the FLYERS their second power play of the game when Brad May\\ntook a tripping penalty at 0:51 of the second. The FLYERS had a little trouble\\ngetting started, but eventually did. Hawgood took a pass as he was moving\\nthroug the neutral zone and handed the puck to Eklund just outside the Sabres\\nblue line along the right boards. Eklund carried into the zone nad passed\\nacross to Dineen who tried a one timer from between the blue line and the\\ntop of the left circle. He half fanned on it, and sent the puck trickling\\nthrough the slot. Fuhr didn\\'t know where it was, though, and Hawgood won the\\nrace to it and flipped it into essentially an open net at 2:15.\\n\\nThen Mogilny on a breakaway. He slipped through two FLYERS at the blue line\\nand went in on Soderstrom. He went with the backhander, but Soderstrom was\\nall over it.\\n\\nThe FLYERS then took some bad discipline type penalties that really hurt them.\\nViacheslav Butsayev took a double minor for roughing and high sticking when\\nBarnaby got under his skin and drew one minor, then according to Gary Dornhoefer\\ntook a dive to get the other (there was no video) at 4:22. The Sabres coudln\\'t\\nget started. Ryan McGill poked at the puck just after a Sabre carried into the\\nFLYERS zone, and after a bunch of people poked at it Dineen emerged with it and\\nheaded the other way. It started out a 1 on 1, but Brind\\'Amour hustled ahead to\\nmake it a 2 on 1 and back off the defenseman. Dineen let it rip from the top\\nof the right circle to make it 3-0 FLYERS at 5:40. That was all for Fuhr, John\\nMuckler sent in Dominik Hasek to take over.\\n\\nBut the Sabres still had lots of power play time. Again they took some time to\\njust get into the FLYERS zone, and when they finally did the FLYERS were all\\nover them. Boos began to ring through the building. But they finally got through\\nSoderstrom on an ugly goal. Smehlik took a shot from the top of the zone that\\nmissed and kicked out to Hawerchuk in the slot. Hawerchuk tried a backhander as\\nhe skated towards the goal line to the right as Galley dove down to block it.\\nMistake #1, he should have let Soderstrom handle the backhander and worried\\nabout A) the rebound or B) Barnaby who was camped behind the goal line right\\nnext to the net. Well, the rebound dropped right next to Soderstrom, and\\nmistake #2, Galley just laid there and watched Barnaby get THREE hacks at the\\npuck before he finally pushed it through the goalie. He didn\\'t even swing his\\nstick out to try and knock the puck away. With the goal, at 7:48, two streaks\\nend for the FLYERS. 150:28 of shutout hockey, and 27 straight penalty kills.\\n\\nLindros put them right back on the power play at 8:36 with a high sticking\\nminor, I think it was Barnaby again. This time the Sabres were able to get\\nset up quickly, but couldn\\'t get too much quality on goal. The Sabres continued\\nto keep the puck in the FLYERS end for a while after the power play ended.\\nThings evetually settled down, but then the other very bad penalty. McGill\\nallowed Barnaby to get under his skin and slashed his stick just before a\\nfaceoff. The gloves were dropped, and McGill started pounding the crap out of\\nhim. But during the fight, he gave Barnaby a head butt with his helmet, and\\nthat meant a match penalty. 2 for slashing, 5 fighting and 5 for the major,\\n7 minutes of power play time for the Sabres at 14:15, Barnaby only got 5.\\n\\nThe FLYERS were keeping them at bay for a while, but there was only so long\\nthey could do that. After a couple of good Sabre chances, Audette handed to\\nLedyard at the point, and Ledyard sent a drive that was knocked down by\\nSoderstrom. LaFontaine whacked at the bouncing puck from the left side of\\nthe net, and knocked it over to Randy Wood at the right. Soderstrom had\\nmoved over to play LaFontaine, and since Yushkevich and Carkner were waving\\nat the puck instead of picking up men, Wood just slid it into the empty net\\nat 17:34 to close the FLYERS lead to 3-2. LaFontaine was actually trying to\\nput it on net, but half fanned on it and got a break.\\n\\nThe FLYERS then got some shorthanded pressure in the Sabres zone, but Hasek\\nwas strong. Finally it was Keith Carney passing ahead to Hawerchuk into the\\nneutral zone, and Hawerchuk sent a good backhand pass to Mogilny at the FLYERS\\nblue line. Another mini-breakaway for Mogilny, he elected to shoot from the\\nleft circle, and he threaded the needle to get it just inside the far post at\\n18:56 for his 75th of the season. Ironically, the youth hockey tip between\\nthe 1st and second period was Tommy Soderstrom talking about cutting off\\nangles...\\n\\nThat was all in the 2nd, shots were 19-7 Sabres.\\n\\nInto the 3rd period, and Pelle EKlund blew a golden opportunity to get the\\nFLYERS the lead back. A 2 on 1, Acton with the puck, he dropped to Eklund in\\nthe slot, and Eklund held the puck as he slid through the left circle until\\nhe had almost no angle at all to shoot from. When he finally did shoot, he\\nhit the far post. That was still during the carryover power play time.\\n\\nThan an incredible almost goal. Randy Wood skated around Recchi and Hawgood\\nuntouched into Soderstrom. Soderstrom goes down, Wood pokes the puck under\\nSoderstrom, and a black object hits the back of the net. Red light comes on,\\nhorn sounds, crowd cheers. But up to the video replay booth, for some strange\\nreason, and in the meantime Emrick and Dornhoefer try to figure out what they\\ncould be reviewing. Well, it turns out that it was the taped up stick blade\\nthat went into the net, not the puck. Emrick mentions that one of the criteria\\nfor scoring a goal is that the puck must go into the net...\\n\\nDave Hannan then took out Recchi and got a holding minor at 2:35. The FLYERS\\ncould not get anything going at all. They finally got set up 1/2 way through,\\nbut were kept on the perimeter. As time ran out, Beranek stripped the puck\\nfrom a Sabre in the offensive zone along the right boards and passed it across\\nto Eklund at the top of the left circle. Eklund saw Dineen heading at the net\\njust inside the right circle and passed through to him. Dineen fumbled the pass,\\nbut twice directed it at Hasek, and Eklund swooped in and chipped the bouncing\\npuck over the goalie for his 11th at 4:42. 4-3 FLYERS.\\n\\nBut the Sabres came right back. LaFontaine picked up the puck in his offensive\\nleft corner and slid it to Bob Erry behind the FLYERS net. Erry started to skate\\nout, but then just dropped the puck back to nobody behind the net. Mogilny flew\\nin, skated around, and stuffed it through Soderstrom\\'s 5 hole for his 76th at\\n5:24 to tie the game at 4.\\n\\nThen Hawerchuk took a retaliatory roughing penalty at 5:55. The FLYERS set up\\nin the Sabres zone, and stayed there. Off a faceoff high in the Sabres zone in\\nthe middle. While Brind\\'Amour wrestled for the puck, Dineen snuck through the\\nline and wristed a perfect shot low to Hasek\\'s glove side at 6:44.\\n\\nPlay started to go back and forth until Hawgood took a roughing penalty at 8:19.\\nThe FLYERS dumped the puck into the Sabres zone. Brind\\'Amour and Ledyard went\\nafter it, and Rod got the puck. He backed away from the right boards, skated\\nto the right faceoff dot, and passed between his legs to Dineen crashing\\nthrough the slot all by himself. Dineen waited patiently and lifted it over\\nthe blocker of Hasek for a 6-4 FLYERS lead at 8:39. 3rd hat trick of the season\\nfor Dineen, 7th of his career, 2nd shorthanded goal of the game for him 35th\\nof the season.\\n\\nThen Carney took a tripping penalty at 9:02 to kill the rest of the Sabres\\npower play. Not much action on the 4 on 4, and the Sabres got most of the\\nchances on the FLYERS resulting power play.\\n\\nPlay went end to end for quite a while after that and both goalies had to\\nmake some big saves. The Sabres weren\\'t able to pull Hasek as time was running \\nout as the FLYERS wouldn\\'t allow any consistant possession for the Sabres.\\nFinally as time was running out Ken Sutton misplayed the puck in his own left\\ncorner and Brind\\'Amour stripped it away from him. He pulled away and found\\nDineen on the other side of the left circle, and Dineen found Acton at the\\nright of Hasek. He slid the puck between two Sabres defenders, and Acton\\nchipped it back to the far side of Hasek for his 8th of the season at 19:48\\non his 35th birthday. That was all the scoring, shots were 18-13 Buffalo,\\nand the ice was showered with plastic drinking mugs handed out before the\\ngame.\\n\\nSo another strong game from Tommy Soderstrom who hadn\\'t been tested much\\nin his last couple of starts. Kevin Dineen has a career high 6 point night\\n(unless he had a better night earlier in the season, but I don\\'t think so).\\nThe FLYERS longest winning streak in 3 years, 30 goals for only 11 against\\nwith three shutouts. Eric Lindros is 8th in league with 33 even strength goals\\ndespite missing 23 games with injury. 4 points out of 4th, clinched 5th place\\nsince the Rangers lose the tie breaker.\\n\\nA couple misc notes:\\n\\nForget the Mike Keenan rumors, there will be a press conference tommorrow to\\nannounce that he will be head coach of the New York Rangers next year.\\n\\nIn the last notes I mentioned that Garry Galley won the Barry Ashbee Award,\\nbut I failed to mention that the award is for the best defenseman.\\n\\nThe Times of Trenton has reported that \"a preeminent specialist from Oklahoma\"\\nhas looked over Tommy Soderstrom\\'s medical record and determined that no\\nfurther tests are necessary in the near future.\\n\\nSame paper had a blurb about Bill Dineen being asked about whether or not he\\nexpected to be back next year. His response was that he wants to come back,\\nhe feels he did a good job this year, but that he would cheerfully accept a\\nrole scouting if Farwell didn\\'t want him back.\\n\\nFLYERS team record watch:\\n\\nEric Lindros:\\n\\n41 goals, 33 assists, 74 points\\n\\n(rookie records)\\nclub record goals:\\t\\t\\tclub record points:\\nEric Lindros\\t40 1992-93\\t\\tDave Poulin\\t76 1983-84\\nBrian Propp\\t34 1979-80\\t\\tBrian Propp\\t75 1979-80\\nRon Flockhart\\t33 1981-82\\t\\tEric Lindros\\t74 1992-93\\nDave Poulin\\t31 1983-84\\t\\tRon Flockhart\\t72 1981-82\\nBill Barber\\t30 1972-73\\t\\tPelle Eklund\\t66 1985-86\\n\\nMark Recchi:\\n\\n52 goals, 69 assists, 121 points.\\n\\nclub record goals:\\t\\t\\tclub record points:\\nReggie Leach\\t61 1975-76\\t\\tMark Recchi\\t121 1992-93*\\nTim Kerr\\t58 1985-86,86-87\\tBobby Clarke\\t119 1975-76\\nTim Kerr\\t54 1983-84,84-85\\tBobby Clarke\\t116 1974-75\\nMark Recchi\\t52 1992-93\\t\\tBill Barber\\t112 1975-76\\nRick Macliesh\\t50 1972-73\\t\\tBobby Clarke\\t104 1972-73\\nBill Barber\\t50 1975-76\\t\\tRick Macliesh\\t100 1972-73\\nReggie Leach\\t50 1979-80\\n\\n*More than 80 games.\\n\\nFLYERS career years:\\n\\nPlayer\\t\\tPoints\\tBest Prior Season\\nMark Recchi\\t121\\t113 (90-91 Penguins)\\nRod Brind\\'Amour\\t84\\t77 (91-92 FLYERS)\\nGarry Galley\\t62\\t38 (84-85 Kings)\\nBrent Fedyk\\t59\\t35 (90-91 Red Wings)\\n\\nThat\\'s all for now...',\n",

Ville Siren\\'s slap\\n shot from the blue line on power play made it 1-1, and Juha Riihijarvi\\n scored a nice goal in another power play when he close in front of goal\\n put the puck high over Aslin, 1-2 after the first period.\\n The Finns started the second period with really good pressure. Korpisalo\\n made it 1-3 with another goal from close range high over Aslin. Then,\\n during the Finnish pressure, Sweden turned the game around in 1:47.\\n Mikael Renberg worked hard behind the Finnish goal, and passed the puck to\\n Jan Larsson in front, who backhanded the puck low, 2-3. Rundqvist entered\\n the Finnish zone and passed to Ahlund, and the Finnish defense let Ahlund \\n skate in and take a shot that Ketterer dropped into the goal, 3-3.\\n Next, Roger Hansson -behind the goal- sent the puck back to the blue line\\n where Roger Akerstrom took a slap shot and Ketterer didn\\'t see the puck since\\n there was traffic in front, 4-3.\\n Third period started with a nice goal by Stefan \"the Shadow\" Nilsson. Stefan\\n and Patrik Juhlin entered the Finnish zone, Patrik passed the puck back to\\n Stefan who alone with Ketterer made no mistake, 5-3.\\n Then, Keijo Sailynoja show started. He reduce and equalized the lead in only\\n 21 seconds! First he scored the 5-4 goal, and after that he came in alone \\n with Aslin but was tripped by Aslin to get a penalty shot. Sailynoja\\n made a nice penalty shot, showed forehand and put in with a low backhand shot.\\n The Swedes seemed to head for a win when Mikael Renberg scored the 6-5 goal\\n late in the game on a nice power play combination. Renberg waited in the slot,\\n showed that he wanted the puck on the backhand side, Ahlund passed the puck\\n and Renberg took a turnaround shot low in Ketterer\\'s goal\\'s far side.\\n But Jari Korpisalo had other plans as he only 28 seconds later scored the\\n game\\'s final goal to make it 6-6. Korpisalo took a slap shot from a narrow\\n angle that -maybe- Aslin should have saved.\\n\\n All in all, a decent game where the defense wasn\\'t the best.\\n Both teams juggled around the lines a bit in the second and third period\\n to try no combinations.\\n\\n Renberg and Rundqvist plays well together in the Swedish team. Larsson-\\n Nilsson-Juhlin best line overall again, it seems to be a working WC line.\\n Stillman good on defense.\\n Some players aren\\'t good enough for the WC though. Hakan Ahlund (faell ner\\n hjaelmen och jobba!), Roger Hansson, Challe Berglund, Kenny Jonsson\\n will likely have to leave for NHL pros.\\n\\n Two-goal scorers Jari Korpisalo and Keijo Sailynoja played well in the\\n Finnish team. Markus Ketterer didn\\'t have a very good game, we\\'ve seen him\\n a lot better, so Lindfors is probably Finland\\'s starting goalie in the WC.\\n I heard that Esa Tikkanen will join the Finnish team. It would be inter-\\n resting to know which other pros coach Matikainen counts on for the WC.\\n \\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n Starting lines:\\n\\n \\tSWEDEN\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFINLAND\\n\\n  35.

Now I think I've seen ads in popular Mac\\nmagazines for products (I'm not sure if it's just a monitor, just a\\nvideo card, or a package of both) that allow you to change resolutions\\non the fly (w/o restarting the Mac).\\n\\nIf you were to buy a 1304, would it be possible to switch back and\\nforth between Apple 640x480 and Apple 832x624 without restarting the\\nMac?  Is this strictly a hardware startup function, or can software\\nintervene, or does the Mac hardware occasionally probe the cable\\nsetting and switch automatically?\\n\\nThanks,\",\n",

The whole organization (read:\\nEJ and Ley, and by default owner Richard Gordon because he was too much of\\na dupe to know how much he was being blind-sided by EJ) dumped on Francis all\\nseason, starting with refusing to sign him to a new contract, publicly \\nhumiliating him, stripping him of the \"C\", and then trading him that Spring\\nto the Penguins. Classy guy, that EJ.\\n\\nThe loss of Francis (and too a lesser extent, Ulf), was one of a series of\\ndecimating player moves by EJ which stripped the personality and fan-awareness\\nfrom the team that has put them in the precarious position they are in today.\\n\\n[Gratuitous good EJ note...he did preside over the organization when it\\nacquired Verbeek, Cassels, Sanderson, Poulin, Nylander, etc. He stripped the\\nroster but he DID lay a foundation.]',\n",

I saw him play in the Swedish championship\\n game for junior players this year, and he played very well, a physical game,\\n but not the kind of rough stuff that Ulfie does (I suspect you would like to\\n have a Ulf type-of-player on the B's team too? :)\\n As for Mariusz Czerkawski, he has had a *great* season for Hammarby in\\n division 1. He scored -if I remember correctly- 93 points this season,\\n and then we have to keep in mind that a 50+ point season in Sweden is\\n considered *very good* due to the limited number of games. Mariusz is\\n Djurgarden property (he was just on loan to Hammarby), so he will play\\n in Elitserien next season, unless the B's can get him of course.\\n I would say that Mariusz has to be one of the most exciting player to\\n watch in Swedish hockey this season.\\n\\n Staffan\",\n",

The most recent expansion \\ndrafts allowed teams to protect two goalies and did not make a distinction \\nbetween forwards and defensemen.\\n        First-year pros only will be exempt from the draft, which is down \\nfrom the two-year exemption teams had last season. San Jose, Tampa Bay and \\nOttawa still will be allowed to exempt second-year pros.\\n        Each of the 24 teams will lose two players, with a maximum loss of \\none goaltender and a maximum loss of one defenseman. The one exception is \\nthat a team which loses a goaltender can then no longer lose a defenseman.\\n        At the end of the first phase of the draft, the two new franchises \\nwill have three goaltenders, eight defensemen and 13 forwards for a total \\nof 24 players. A second phase then will be conducted where San Jose, Tampa \\nBay and Ottawa will select two players each from the rosters of the two \\nnew teams.\\n        Ottawa, Tampa Bay and San Jose will be guaranteed priority \\ndrafting selection in the 1993 draft as long as they have the three worst \\nrecords. Anaheim and Miami will choose no lower than fourth and fifth. The \\nexpansion franchises will move up in the draft should either San Jose, \\nTampa Bay or Ottawa not finish in the bottom three positions.\\n        The two new teams will pick first and second in the 1994 Entry \\nDraft, regardless of their finish in 1993-94. Should either of the two new \\nteams not play next season they would have priority drafting position in \\n1994.\\n\\n        The owners announced the 1994 draft will be in Hartford and the \\n1995 draft in Winnipeg. The 1994 draft was scheduled for Boston, but a \\ndelay in the construction of a new arena required the draft be moved.\\n\\n-----\\n \\n- League news:\\n\\nDisputes:\\n\\n  The NHL owners and players have resolved differences over salary \\narbitration procedures, clearing the way for about 40 hearings.

There are five major scoring zones: \\n(1) upper left corner of goal, (2) upper right, (3) lower left, (4) lower \\nright, and (5) five-hole.\\n \\n Q: What is the meaning of throwing an octopus on the ice?\\n A: This tradition began in Detroit in the 1950\\'s when two best-of-seven \\nseries were required to win the Stanley Cup. Every time Detroit won a \\ngame, an octopus with one less arm was thrown on the ice.\\n\\n Q: Who was the first woman to play in an NHL game?\\n A: Manon Rheaume, a 20-year-old goaltender, became the first woman ever \\nto play in an NHL game on September 23, 1992 when she started in net for \\nthe expansion Tampa Bay Lightning in an exhibition against the St. Louis \\nBlues.

Ahola had\\nonly played 50 games this season (I think it\\'s actually less; the San Jose\\nMercury News may be in err here), 20 of them with the Sharks.  In the games he\\nhas played, he appeared quite solid defensively, although he hasn\\'t been\\nspectacular, and his offense isn\\'t anything to write home about (8 points);\\nit\\'s even possible that the trade may be for future considerations which turn\\nout to be ...

In those games,\\nhe did not impress anyone; after generating 7 shots in the first period of\\nthe first game he played, he scored just 2 points in his tenure up here with\\nthe Sharks, and was even less impressive defensively, as he appeared awkward\\nwith his movement and was prone to giveaways.  He needs to make a leap in\\nhis level of performance to have any chance of making the team.\\n\\n#38\\tPAT MACLEOD\\t\\tSeason: 2nd\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (?)\\n\\nMacLeod was on the roster a lot longer than Kolstad, but it appears to my\\nmemory that he played less than Kolstad, because the Sharks were reluctant to\\nuse him, but were even more reluctant to send him to the minors, figuring that\\nhe wouldn\\'t clear waivers; in fact, he has played the past 4-5 weeks with\\nKansas City, but is still technically there on a rehabilitation assignment,\\na \"rehab assignment\" that will include him playing in the Turner Cup playoffs.\\nSince he has played so little, I can\\'t even give a tentative grade on him, but\\nhe demonstrated last year excellent offensive skills but terrible defensive\\nskills.\\n\\n#41\\tTOM PEDERSON\\t\\tSeason: 1st\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (B+)\\n\\nCalled up in the middle of the season when the defensive corps was decimated\\nby injuries, Pederson impressed many Sharks fan here on net, including yours\\ntruly.  He demonstrated very good offensive skills, scoring 20 points in\\n43 games.  However, his size (5\\' 9\", 165 lbs.) is of concern, and soon after\\nhe began to shine offensive did teams begin to push him around physically,\\non both sides of the ice, although he had appeared fearless in his approach.\\nBut to be successful, he probably needs to bulk up to have a fighting chance\\non surviving against some of the bigger players in the league.\\n\\n#45\\tCLAUDIO SCREMIN\\t\\tSeason: 1st\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (D+/D)\\n\\nHe played all of ~5 games in the league this year, but was thoroughly\\numimpressive, just as he was at the end of last season; again, it may be a\\nsmall sample, but just as in the case of Kolstad, Scremin, at age 25, is\\nquickly running out of time.

A tie occurs when a game ends\\nwith the score for each team equal.  Each team gets one point for a tie. \\nThere also exits these things called \"wins\".  A win is when one team has a\\nhigher score than the opponent.  (Oh yeah, only two teams play each other\\nat a time, so I can say \"the opponent\".)  A team gets two points for a\\nwin.  So, let\\'s say that a team has a record of 38 wins, 36 losses, and 10\\nties.  Another team has a record of 40 wins, 38 losses and 6 ties.  The\\nfirst team has (38*2)+10 = 86 points.  The second team has (40*2)+6 = 86\\npoints.  WOW!  They *both* have the same number of points, but the number\\nof wins is different!  How did they do that??!?!?!?!  That\\'s amazing.  So,\\nRex, when people talk about wins being the first tiebreaker, well, then\\nthat\\'s what it means.  In our example, the second team would win the\\ntiebreaker and therefore have the \"better\" record, even though both teams\\nhad the same number of points.

Thanks,\\n\\n\\nI have been using the PLI (SONY) 3.5\" MO drive and now a Sharp color\\nscanner using standard SCSI cables and STANDARD $20 terminator on my Q700. \\nNo problems.  If you were using a IIfx, that might be another story.\\n\\nMake sure there is only one terminator in the cabling and it must be at the\\nend.  Some boxes have internal terminators; some can be switched out and\\nothers are socketted.  These count.  If the box with internal terminations\\ncannot be put on the end to terminate the cabling, they have to be\\ndisabled, ie, switched out or pulled out of their sockets.  If you have 2\\nboxes with internal terminations, the terminations in one box has to be\\ndisabled...., etc.  I am sure that this has been covered by the \"experts\".\\n\\nMy experience with SCSI boxes that connect to the Mac indicates that they\\nmust have some software package for the Mac to \\'talk\\' to them.

       " 'By Dave Luecking Of The Post-Dispatch Staff\\n\\nAt 9:11 Thursday night, the scoreboard watchers at The Arena began to cheer.\\nTheir cheer quickly turned into a roar, and finally, the sellout crowd of\\n17,816 rose as one to rock the old barn at 5700 Oakland Avenue in a salute to\\nthe playoff-bound Blues.\\n\\nThe scoreboard had just flashed the news from Detroit -- Red Wings 5, Stars 3.\\nWith the North Stars\\' loss, the Blues officially clinched fourth place and the\\nfinal playoff spot in the Norris Division. Good thing, because the Blues quit\\nplaying.\\n\\nThey held a 5-1 lead over Tampa Bay when the Detroit-Minnesota final appeared\\nwith 3 minutes 52 remaining in the second period. They promptly went to sleep\\nand barely held on for a 6-5 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer.\\nTampa\\'s Bob Beers tipped in a pass from Shawn Chambers, but officiating\\nsupervisor John D\\'Amico and video goal judge Rich Schweigler ruled that the\\nshot had gone into the net after time had expired.\\n\\n``I\\'m glad I didn\\'t see it go in at the end,\" Blues coach Bob Berry said.\\n\\nIf the goal had counted, he\\'d have been more upset than he was by the Blues\\'\\ndisappearance in the final 24 minutes. Holding on for the victory and making\\nthe playoffs tempered Berry\\'s anger.\\n\\n``It wasn\\'t pretty at the end,\" he said. ``We played 36, 37 great minutes, as\\ngood as we played all year. It slipped away at the end. It shouldn\\'t have, but\\nit did.\"\\n\\nStill, the Blues won, prompting another ovation from the crowd at game\\'s end.\\nDespite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this\\nseason, the Blues still made the playoffs. They\\'ll meet the Chicago Blackhawks\\nin a best-of-seven Norris Division semifinal, beginning at noon Sunday at\\nChicago Stadium.\\n\\nThe Blues finished the regular-season with a record of 37-36-11 for 85 points,\\ntheir fourth consecutive plus-.500 season. Minnesota finished three points\\nbehind in fifth place, with a record of 36-38- 10 for 82 points. Tampa Bay,\\nwhich played spoiler last week by tying the Blues 2-2 at Tampa, ended its\\nfirst season with a record of 23-54-7 for 53 points.\\n\\nThe poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous\\nBlues locker room. Instead, the mood was one of relief and some disappointment.\\n\\n``It\\'s a shame we let down,\" said Kevin Miller, one of three Blues to score\\ntwo goals. Brendan Shanahan and Bob Bassen were the others.\\n``There was no need for a letdown. If we\\'d have kept working, it would have\\nended 6-2 and everyone would be happy.\"\\n\\nInstead, a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs.\\n``We won, and that\\'s all that matters,\" said Brett Hull, scoreless and minus-3\\nfor the night. ``Once we got up 4-0, it was really tough to play.\"\\n\\nSome players didn\\'t have a problem.\\n\\n``Just because the score was announced, our line didn\\'t quit,\" said Rich\\nSutter, who played with Bassen and Miller. ``We still had a game to play. You\\ncan\\'t allow five goals like we did, that\\'s not right.\\n\\n``It was disappointing to see what was going on.\"\\n\\nBassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the Blues\\' effort. Somehow,\\nhe missed the announcement of Minnesota\\'s loss.\\n\\n``I didn\\'t know it was final,\" he said. ``I was kind of looking around on the\\nbench. I didn\\'t realize it was a final for some reason. We\\'re in the playoffs,\\nand that\\'s great, but it\\'s a little disappointing to play like we did at the\\nend.\"\\n\\nThe letdown was precisely the reason that Berry had instructed the scoreboard\\noperators to keep the Minnesota-Detroit score off of the board. The score\\nshowed 0-0 until it first popped up with Detroit leading 4-2 in the third\\nperiod. The Blues already led 4-0 at the time.\\n\\n``I told them I didn\\'t want to see the score, I didn\\'t want to know the score,\"\\nBerry said. ``I felt we had to win the game, and that\\'s the approach we took.\"\\n\\nIf Minnesota took a lead, Berry feared, the pressure of having to win might\\nbother the Blues. If Detroit led, he worried, the Blues might quit.\\n\\nUntil the announcement, the Blues played splendidly. Shanahan got the crowd\\ngoing at 10:44 of the first period, scoring his 50th of the season. Then,\\nMiller and Bassen took charge late in the period.\\n\\nWith the teams playing four on four, Miller broke in on left wing, deked\\ndefenseman Roman Hamrlik and beat former Blues goalie Pat Jablonski with the\\nrebound of his own shot with 21.6 seconds remaining in the period.\\n\\nThen, just 10.5 seconds later, Bassen rifled a long slap shot past Jablonski\\nafter defenseman Rick Zombo intercepted a Tampa pass in the neutral zone.\\n\\nBassen made it 4-0 just 14 seconds into the second period, scoring on the \\nrebound of Bret Hedican\\'s shot. The goal gave him his first two-goal game of\\nthe season and reminded him of a special friend.\\n\\nLast year, Bassen befriended young Oliver Mulvihill, who died of a rare form\\nof cancer at age 6 on Feb. 23.\\n\\n``I was thinking of my buddy Oliver,\" Bassen said. ``He\\'s in heaven now, and\\nI know he was watching. I know he\\'s happy.\"\\n\\nMiller increased the Blues lead to 5-0 on a break-away goal set up by Zombo\\nat 11:09. Then, Steve Maltais broke Curtis Joseph\\'s shutout just 18 seconds\\nlater, making it 5-1.\\n\\nLess than a minute after the North Stars\\' final was announced, Tim Bergland\\nscored and cut the lead to 5-2. But Shanahan scored his 51st, converting a pass\\nfrom Nelson Emerson with 21.3 seconds remaining in the  second period.\\n\\nThen, it was all Lightning. Adam Creighton scored 40 seconds into the third\\nperiod, prompting Berry to rest the overworked Joseph. Guy Hebert allowed goals\\nto Shawn Chambers and Danton Cole in a span of 1:21 midway through the third\\nperiod.\\n\\nThe goals by Chambers and Cole made Shanahan\\'s second goal stand up as the\\nwinner. ``We were in there,\" Shanahan said. ``The game was over. We were in.\"',\n",

I never, ever thought that anyone\\nwould argue that Jagr\\'s higher +/- actually reflected better two-way\\nplay.\\n\\nIn my opinion, Francis\\'s low +/- is purely a result of him being asked\\nto play against opponents top scorers at all times; the fact that he\\ncan chip in 100 points while neutralizing the other team\\'s top center\\nis a testament to how valuable he is, even if his +/- suffers.  On the\\nother hand, Jagr, for how big, fast and skilled he is, can\\'t even get\\n90 points, no matter how inflated his +/- is.\\n\\n(By the way, don\\'t get me wrong -- I like Jagr.

Come on,\\nJoe, think about what you're saying! Who they played is VERY significant.\\nWhy they played them is what's irrelevent. A low GAA against good teams\\nis better than a low GAA against bad teams in the context of comparing two\\ngoaltenders. A low GAA is better then a higher GAA. A low GAA against good\\nteams is much, much better than a higher GAA against bad teams in the context\\nof comparing two goaltenders.\\n\\n\\nYES IT DOES! Absolutely. **In the context of comparing two goaltenders**.\\nOf course, at the end of the season 2 points is 2 points no matter how you\\nget them. And on the score sheets shutouts are shutouts. But if you're a\\ncoach deciding between two goalies, or a GM looking to make a trade, you\\nhave got to look deeper than the stat sheets. I didn't see the second Toronto\\ngame, but the first one was a defensive masterpiece. There was nothing in\\nthat game to judge Tommy Soderstrom on because he wasn't tested. The same\\nfor Roussel in the Ranger game. Two real scoring chances, one he made a\\ngreat play, the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. If\\nyou were judging Roussel on that game alone, you have very little to go by.\\n\\nBut if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs, you saw a goalie\\nstand on his head to get that shutout. THAT was a #1 goalie in action. Roussel\\ndoesn't have a game like that in him.\\n\\n\\nDon't be so sure of that. FLYERS management never says bad thing about\\nRoussel, but they don't say too much on the good side either. I've seen\\nat least two interviews where every time Farwell was asked how happy he was\\nto have two good goaltenders, it was Tommy this, Tommy that, and oh, yeah,\\nDom has played well too.\\n\\n\\nFLYERS in the NHL Hall of Fame. Kinda dull, really. They handed out a\\nteam picture to everybody who walked in from Pizza Hut, but it was the\\nsame picture they sold in the programs in mid-season. Had names like Benning,\\nKasper...\\n\\n\\nMostly random seat locations, some were given out by having certain\\nautographs on the team photos.

So I got an RMA from La Cie and\\nexchanged the new drive for a reconditioned one.\\n\\nWell, about a month has passed now and the second drive is having problems.\\nOften, when I boot up my IIsi I get the flashing question mark. Sometimes, if I\\nthen insert the Silverlining (5.42) program I can get it to recognize the drive\\nby making it scan over and over for drives. At that point I can restart the\\nIIsi and boot from the HD. I\\'ve called La Cie again and they\\'ve given me\\nanother RMA. Their tech support people tell me that if Silverlining doesn\\'t see\\nthe drive there\\'s a definite hardware problem.\\n\\nGiven that this is the second bad drive in four months, I asked La Cie to send\\nme a *new* one, but they said \"no.\" Also, within three weeks after I purchased\\nmy original drive, La Cie dropped the price on it by over $100.\\n\\nI can accept that a drive (or two) may be bad. And I know that hardware vendors\\nmake a practice of sending reconditioned replacements when they do repairs. And\\nI understand that the nature of the computer industry lends itself to sudden\\nprice fluctuations. Nevertheless, taken together, the convergence of these\\nfacts/events have left a bad taste in my mouth.

       " 'Just a quick summary of recent findings re. high speed modems. Top three\\ncontenders seem to be AT&T Paradyne, ZyXEL, and US Robotics. ZyXEL has the\\nbiggest \"cult following\", and can be had for under $300, but I ignored it\\nbecause I need something with Mac software, which will work without any\\ntweaking.\\n\\nThe AT&T Dataport earns nearly unanimous praises for reliability. They are\\nbackordered at the moment, probably because of the special $299 price in\\neffect until May. Its fax capabilities are worse than that of the other two\\nmodems. WARNING: AT&T ads say that the modem comes with a Mac kit (cables &\\nall), and has lifetime warranty. This applies *only* when you order\\ndirectly from Paradyne! I called ElekTek (one of the distributors), and\\nthey wanted to charge me $16 for cable, and gave only 1 year warranty...\\n\\nUSR Sportster for the Mac is also highly (but not as highly) recommended;\\nit\\'s only $250 from ClubMac, and if you are willing to roll your own cable\\nand don\\'t care about the FAXstf software, you can get the generic model\\nfrom PC outlets for $190.\\n\\nAll this assuming that you don\\'t have a rich uncle, and can\\'t afford a\\nMotorola Codex...  :-(    I ended up ordering the Dataport; we\\'ll see how\\nit works in two weeks or so.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nYou think that's bad ... one year, we had all three New York teams in\\nthe playoffs and the cableco operator (SCNY once shared a channel with\\nBET but someone forgot to throw the switch at 6PM) didn't know what I\\nwas talking about ...\\n\\nWhile it's nice that the NHL is back on American network TV, it faces\\nthe same problems as it did with the All Star game.  Local preemptions\\nand zero promotion (okay, I don't watch that much TV so I'm just foaming\\nall right?).

Not exactly invisible.\\n\\n\\nWell, having gotten to a chance to talk to him a few times, this isn\\'t quite\\naccurate.

The Sharks then sent him to K.C., at which\\npoint he disclosed the injury. Since he didn\\'t disclose it, the Sharks and\\nhe disagreed about the responsibility and he was suspended for not\\nreporting. That was eventually worked out, the Sharks re-instated him as\\ninjured and put him into therapy, and when he was able to play then shipped\\nhim down to K.C. He fully expects to play in the NHL again, although clearly\\nnot with the Sharks (hiding injuries is a stupid no-no, beyond just a\\nno-no).\\n\\nVery nice guy. Always hustled his butt off. He disappeared because he was\\nhurt. I expect he\\'ll surface with another team at some point (probably\\nanother expansion team), but is likely to be a bubble player for the rest of\\nhis career.

Unfortunately, he played himself out of the Sharks future with a\\nbad judgement call.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlways gave 110%, best work ethic on the club (except maybe Kisio), but\\nhustle isn\\'t always enough. His future with the Sharks was made clear to me\\none night against the Flames when he went behind the crease and tried to\\nhold Joel Otto against the board. He literally had one arm around Otto\\'s\\nneck and another wrapped around Otto\\'s stick arm. Otto casually turned\\naround and fed the puck in front of the crease for a goal, as though Carter\\nwasn\\'t there. Hustle can only cover size so far.\\n\\nThe Sharks have told me, point blank, that he\\'s gone for good (ditto HUbie\\nMcDonough).

It would indeed be unfair for me to do anything but give him a passing\\ngrade (and skip the letter grading), but he had simply been awful on ice this\\nyear, save for a bright spot or two, and even if he had been healthy, he would\\nnot be any more than the 3rd-string goalie.\\n\\nBut Hayward was a classy individual, who also figured in on the Sharks' first\\never victory, the 3rd game of the season last year against the Calgary Flames.\\nAs he retires, the fans will remember what a good guy he was.\\n\\n#30\\tJEFF HACKETT\\t\\tSeason: 3rd\\nAcquired:\\t'91-92, from N. Y. Islanders in expansion draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tC\\n\\nHackett, after (deservedly) winning the team MVP honors last season, simply\\nwasted the year.  Other than a few good spots (57 saves against Los Angeles,\\nalmost-shutout against Tampa Bay, etc.), Hackett, finishing with 85.6% save\\npercentage and a 5.28 GAA, watched his status go from the team's #1 goalie to\\nbench decoration at the end of the season.  He was expected, early, to carry\\nthe team along; instead, he apparently became frustrated, but the an early\\ninjury that forced him to miss 12 games may have been a contributing factor,\\nbut upon return, he simply wasn't up to the task.  He may not return next\\nyear.\\n\\n#31\\tWADE FLAHERTY\\t\\tSeason: 1st (still eligible as rookie)\\nAcquired:\\t'91-92, signed as undrafted free agent\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (A-)\\n\\nIt is pretty hard to evaluate a goaltender on just one game alone, thus the\\nincomplete grade, but yet in the one start that he did get (against the Calgary\\nFlames), Flaherty was nothing but sharp for at least two periods.  He started\\nthe season poorly in Kansas City, but finished strong, prompting the Blades'\\nowner Ron Parker to comment that he should be a candidate for the IHL MVP\\nhonors.  The upcoming IHL playoffs would be a major challenge for him as he\\ntries to make it into the NHL; last year, he was a capable backup for Arturs\\nIrbe in the throughout the season and in the Turner Cup playoffs, picking up\\nall-star honors along with Irbe; now it's time for him to show that he can\\nshare the job with Irbe next year, because with prospects Dan Ryder, Trevor\\nRobins, and Scott Cashman coming along, if he doesn't make it next year, he\\nmay not ever.\\n\\n#32\\tARTURS IRBE\\t\\tSeason:\\t1st\\nAcquired:\\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tB+\\n\\nI may yet be overly critical of Irbe in a year that he clearly established that\\nhe's a bona fide NHL goaltender, perhaps a bona fide #1 goaltender.  He has\\nprovided most of the little highlight footage that the Sharks team had, getting\\nthe team's first ever shut-out against the Los Angeles Kings on December 26.\\nHe has been fearless in and out of the net, aggressively playing the puck and\\nmaking passes, reminding people of a young Ron Hextall (except, of course, the\\ngoonism).  Yet he still needs to develop more consistency, which is hard to do\\nwith such a bad defense in front of him, but if the Sharks are to challenge for\\na playoff spot next season, Irbe's the key, as he demonstrated in being named\\nas a star of the game 13 times in 32 starts.\",\n",

The 1992 Olympic teams contained about\\nas much talent as your average expansion team. Canada had Eric Lindros, Sean\\nBurke, Joe Juneau and Chris Kontos. Another four or five have been deep subs in\\nthe NHL. As for the Yanks, Keith Tkachuk, Scott Lachance, Bret Hedican, Shawn \\nMcEachern, Steve Heintze, Ted Donato, Joe Sacco and Bill Guerin have been \\n3rd/4th line players in the NHL, while Robb Stauber has done well for the \\nKings in goal. Nothing more. In fact, I\\'m sure that an All-Star team assembled\\nfrom the best Finnish League teams would do no better in the NHL than Hartford \\nor Tampa Bay currently are doing.\\n---\\nBut what happens if _all_ top-class Finnish & Swedish players gradually end up\\nwith Helsinki & Stockholm as the North American-based ones gradually retire and\\nno Canadian/American team is allowed to draft new players from Scandinavia? \\nHere is what THE HOCKEY NEWS scouts think of our NHL-based players:\\n\\n(28-30=superstar)\\n(23-27=star)\\n(18-22=NHL regular+)\\n(13-17=NHL regular)\\n( 8-12=role player)\\n\\nFINLAND:  \\n\\nD-Jyrki Lumme.......20\\nD-Teppo Numminen....20\\nD-Peter Ahola.......13\\n\\nC-Jari Kurri........25\\nC-Christian Ruuttu..16\\n\\nR-Teemu Selanne.....27\\n\\nL-Esa Tikkanen......20\\n(Obviously, Selanne\\'s ratings would be higher today than they were in January)\\n\\nSWEDEN:\\nD-Ulf Samuelsson....21\\nD-Fredrik Olausson..20\\nD-Niklas Lidstrom...18\\nD-Calle Johansson...18\\nD-Kjell Samuelsson..17\\nD-Tommy Sjodin......13\\nD-Tommy Albelin......7\\n\\nC-Mats Sundin.......26\\nC-Thomas Steen......18\\n\\nR-Thomas Sandstrom..22\\nR-Ulf Dahlen........18\\nR-Michael Nylander..13\\n\\nL-Per-Erik Eklund...18\\nL-Johan Garpenlov...16\\nL-Mikael Andersson..15\\nL-Jan Erixon........14\\n\\nThis would be interesting. Clearly, Finland\\'s top five players (Winnipeg\\'s\\nSelanne & Numminen, Vancouver\\'s Lumme, Los Angeles\\' Jari Kurri and New York\\'s\\nTikkanen) are right up there with any five-man unit Pittsburgh & co. have. But\\nI have my doubts about the home-based Finnish players - the national team did\\nwell in the Canada Cup and World Championships largely due to the efforts of\\nMarkus Ketterer (the goalie), 3-4 or the players listed above and luck. There\\'s\\npresumably a lot of decent players in Finland that wouldn\\'t be superstars at\\nthe highest level but still valuable role players, however. My guess would be\\nthat the Finnish Canada Cup team would be a .500 team in the NHL.\\n---\\nSweden is easier to judge because they have more players in North America.\\nTheir points total (16 players) is 274 - seven more than Ottawa\\'s 22 top\\nplayers combined! If we estimate there are six more NHL regulars back home in \\nSweden, an all-Swedish team would assemble about 350-360 skill points.\\nDeducting some points from Pittsburgh, NY Rangers and other teams that rely on\\nSwedish players, the Swedish team would finish in sixth place - about as high\\nas Boston, Vancouver, Calgary and Montreal on paper! So, the \"dynasty\" talk\\nisn\\'t completely unfounded here. An all-Finnish/all-Swedish team might have an\\nadvantage because the players would be playing at home half of the time,\\nwon\\'t have to adapt to a foreign country and a foreign language, and presumably\\nplay the wide-open European variant of hockey rather than have to learn the\\nNorth American checking game. However, if free agency becomes a factor the top \\nScandinavian players still might end up playing for large-market teams after a \\ncouple of years the same way Edmonton\\'s \"dynasty\" crumbled in the late \\'80s. \\nSome fringe players likely will be drafted by other NHL teams as having an \\nexclusive talent pool might be a bit unfair after all. I\\'d settle for a \\ncompromise, prohibit all European teams from signing a North American during \\nthe first two rounds but allow them to keep their top two players.

This time, I was told that Apple had decided the\\nserial number on my mouse (MB13831FC25) is not within the (undisclosed)\\nrange Apple is willing to replace, and there is nothing I can do about it.\\n\\nNothing, that is, unless enough people complain about this problem to make\\nit worth Apple\\'s while to fix or replace the entire lot of defective mice.\\nPlease, if you have one of these mice, I NEED YOUR HELP!

       " '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNice try Deepak, but \"tough Whaler squad\" should have clued you in to the\\nfact that my Leaf woofing was tongue-in-cheek.\\n\\nIf playoff hockey is any more intense than the regular season variety then\\nit is because the teams are facing each other at least 4 consecutive times\\nin 7 days and hockey being the contact sport that it is, some things will\\nbe carried over that might dissipate during the regular season.  But that is\\nonly for some of the players.  Many of the rest, who have been playing with\\ninjuries, who miss their families, or who, like Grant Fuhr, would really\\nrather be playing golf, don\\'t really give a damn.  Of course I can\\'t say this\\nfor sure, but I believe that this is fairly typical of human nature and I\\ndon\\'t think that hockey players are above having what I consider typically\\nhuman attitudes.  \\n\\nWith the recent salary escalations the key players are actually losing \\nmoney by participating in the playoffs.  The ones who regard the playoff\\n\"take\" as some kind of a bonanza are fringe players who are unlikely\\nto consistently be a force in the playoffs.  Now I know some of you are\\ngoing to come back with \"winning spirit\" and all of that crap but these\\nplayers are professionals after all.  While they may love to play the \\ngame that love is entirely incidental to their purpose, which is, to make\\na decent living. \\n\\nOf course, the coach is a professional as well, and part of what he is \\nbeing paid to do is motivate the players.  So, if the coach does his\\njob well enough the players may respond with a winning effort.\\n\\nThe second season, is after all, merely an exhibition.  The true Champions\\nof the league are the division winners, the teams that come out on top \\nafter the long struggle of the season.  The Stanley cup playoffs merely\\naccord victory to the team that has remained healthy and \"hot\".  The \\nemphasis on the playoffs, with their \"sudden death\" appeal has been promoted\\nby the media and the owners with profit purely in mind.  Even if Pittsburgh\\nloses the playoffs, we all know that they were really the best team in the\\nleague over the year.  They proved it.\\n\\ncordially, as always,\\n\\nrm\\n',\n",

       " 'I had the same question for my 55lb NEC 5FG monitor. The Apple guy said that\\ntheir 50lb 16\" monitor is OK to put ontop of the Centris and had no coment\\nbeyond that. I was going to just put the NEC on the box but then I got to \\nthinking - the monitor has a small tilt/swivel base so maybe the weight\\nwould be more concentrated than with Apple\\'s (I don\\'t know the area of the \\nbase of their tilt/swivel). Additionally, the CDROM drive is in the middle.\\nSo I cut a piece of 3/8\" thick wood to about 16.25\" x 12\", covered it in a \\ncream covered cloth, and used it as a buffer layer between the Centris\\'s top\\nand the monitor!!\\n\\nMick Mueck  mick.mueck@analog.com',\n",

When I ran into space problems, I slapped in\\nanother 40 meg quantum that I had sitting on a shelf. Here is what I did.\\n \\nFirst off, I was concerned about space. Since both drives are Quantum\\nquarter height drives, I finally decided that the logical place for them\\nwas stacked one upon the other. Fine, they fit snugly. (I have not had a\\nproblem with heat yet, and these drives have been running together for\\nover two months.\\n\\nThe next problem was connecting the drive. If you have a spare internal\\nhard disk power cable as I did, then half of your troubles are over. just\\nsplice in the extra cable so that you get one square motherboard\\nconnector and two hard disk power connectors. If you don't have a spare\\ncable, you will have to buy the wires and connectors which can be found\\nin any good electronics store for about $10. I would suggest properly\\nsoldering/heatshrinking the connections to reduce the possibility of\\nshorts or bad connections.\\n\\nNext, you need a ribbon cable connection. Again, I had a spare hard disk\\nribbon cable, and I wanted to be careful in case this didn't word so what\\nI did was purchase a crimp on 50 pin cable connector that gave me another\\nmale connector in the middle of my spare cable. The part cost $10 again,\\nand is easily attached with any good wood vice. The theory behind using a\\ncrimp on connector is that if this doesn't work, my original cable is not\\ndamaged, and I can go back to the original setup.\\n\\nHaving done all that, I couldn't be bothered to check the dev notes for\\npower consumption so I plugged it in and it works like a charm to this\\nday. \\n\\nIn a mac II, everything should work the same. Be careful with the ID's of\\nthe drive, and ensure that the terminating resistors on both drives are\\nintact. I did not try this without the terminating resistors but it\\nseemed logical that if I am splitting the SCSI chain, that the signal\\nshould be terminated at all the ends.\\n\\nLet me know if you have any more questions.\",\n",

For example, one cannot edit a 32-bit color picture done on a OS/2 \\n486 with a SVGA monitor on a 386 with VGA {18-bit color palette} and DOS 5.0 \\nand still have ALL the colors one started out with}.\\nLater IBM machines will have integrated graphics accelerators, faster \\nprocessors, and modular upgradeability and may have built-in sound cards, CD \\nROM, and Ethernet (PC Week 12/14/92).  \\nMDA: Monocrome Display Adapter\\n original character-mapped video mode, no graphics, 80x25 text.\\nCGA: Color Graphics Array\\n 320x200 4 colors or 640x200 b/w, 16 color palette, bad for the eyes.\\nEGA:  Enhanced Graphics Array\\n 640x350 16 colors from 64 color palette [and some lower res]; some versions \\n could run at 256 colors, bearable on the eyes.\\nVGA:  Video Graphics Array*\\n 320x200 at 256 colors, 640x480 at 16 colors, and some others, these two are \\n the most commonly used.  All modes have a 256K CLUT, from a \\n 18 to 24-bit {IBM} or a 32-bit {Mac} color palette.  25.175 MHz Pixel Clock\\n (Mel Martinez).  Monitors use analog input, incompatible with TTL signals\\n from EGA/CGA etc. \\nMCGA:  Multi-Color Graphics Array*\\n subset of VGA that provides all the features of MDA & CGA, but lacks some EGA \\n and VGA modes, like VGA 640x480x16 (Dictionary of Computer Terms-DCT).  \\n Common on the initial PS/1 implementation from IBM and some PS/2 Models.\\nSVGA:  Super VGA*\\n This is not a standard in the way the others were, but instead was a \\'catch \\n all\\' category for a group of video cards.  As such, with each manufacturer \\n using their own implementation scheme, SVGA was chaos with people debating\\n as to what is SVGA and what is not.  In an effort to make SVGA more of a \\n standard VESA was established and is used in the newer units, but things\\n are still a mess.  Video is either 512K [~1990] or 1M [today], resolution\\n of 800x600 and 1024x768 at 16 and 256 colors are common, newer ones [since \\n 1990] have the Sierra HiColor RAMDAC, giving 15-bit 32,768 colors at 800x600, \\n some of the very newer ones [~6/92] can do 24 bits per pixel [usually \\n at 640x480].  Speedwise, too much variation, some very slow [Western Digital \\n Paradise based, for example], some very fast [S3 86C911 based, for example], \\n some are so-so [like Tseng ET4000, a very popular chipset].  Some limiting \\n factors overcome by 40MHz VL Bus & 386\\'s linear address mapping were: \\n 8.33 MHz ISA bus, AT architecture where the CPU looks at the card through a \\n 64K \"window\", etc.\\nOther non-SVGA standards: \\n8514/a:\\n IBM\\'s own standard, interlacing graphics accelerator with graphics functions \\n like linedraw, polygon fill, etc. in hardware. Some clone implementations \\n from ATI are the fastest video available today, though some clone models do \\n not have interlacing. \\nTMS34010/34020: high end graphics co-processors, usually >$1000, some\\n do 24-bit, speeds up vector-oriented graphics like CAD.\\nXGA:  eXtended Graphics Array\\n newer and faster than 8514/a, only available for MCA bus-based PS/2s, clones \\n are coming out soon.

Since this is an architecture, its resolution and color depth \\n isn\\'t fixed {IBM implements only 16-bit [65,536] color, while other \\n companies can have 24-bit color through IBM technical licenses}. Refresh \\n rates up to 75 Hz, ensures flicker free, rock solid images to reduce visual \\n discomfort, and is VGA compatible. Up to 1280x1024 on OS/2.\\n*some monitor types usable by Mac-See Mac section above for specific details.\\n\\nExpansion\\nBoth Mac & IBM\\nSCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM.\\n Allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, Nubus card \\n expansion {Mac Plus only}, some monitors, and CD-ROM.  \\n Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal \\n terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port \\n {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the \\n end.  Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}. \\nSCSI-1:  7 devices per SCSI controller.  8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}\\n and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfers.  Difference is due to SCSI-1 software\\n drivers.  \"Fast SCSI-1\" is a misname for 8-bit SCSI-2 in SCSI-1 mode\\n {see SCSI-2 for details}.\\nSCSI-2: 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode.  SCSI-2 is fully\\n SCSI-1 compliant and 8-bit SCSI-2 tends to be implemented as a very fast\\n SCSI-1 since it does not require the different controller interfaces in  \\n hardware and software that 16 and 32-bit SCSI-2 do.  Transfer speeds are\\n 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and\\n 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst {32-bit/wide and fast}.  Since 8-bit SCSI-2 can\\n use SCSI-1 software drivers and hardware at 8-bit SCSI-2 speeds and as such\\n is limited to 7 devices sometimes it is mistakenly called \"fast SCSI-1\". \\n 16-bit fast SCSI-2 requires a SCSI-2 software driver and SCSI-2 electronics\\n but can still use the SCSI-1 ports.  Wide 16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 require a\\n different SCSI port, electronics, and software driver from SCSI-1 {Which\\n makes them more expensive than other SCSI interfaces}.\\nMac SCSI: asynchronous SCSI-1 built-in standard since the Plus.  Even though \\n Apple developed some specifications for SCSI controlers, the OS SCSI Manager\\n needs to be rewritten to take full advantage of the features of both SCSI\\n interfaces.  As a result present SCSI-2 Macs use 8-bit SCSI-2 as a fast \\n asynchronous SCSI-1.  Presently Quadras are the only Macs with a SCSI-2\\n controller chip built-in (Digital Review, Oct 21, 1991 v8 n33 p8(1)) \\n though they lack some other parts of the hardware, like the wide SCSI-2 port \\n interface.  Since other Macs require a NuBus card to use SCSI-2, older NuBus \\n Macs had a bottleneck due to the speed of the NuBus and CPU.  Rumor-some\\n Cyclone Macs {June} will come with a wide & fast SCSI-2 port standard \\n and have a rewritten OS SCSI manager.\\nIBM SCSI:  SCSI-1 is not too wide spread yet, generally not bundled with \\n systems, except as add-on {EISA and VESA Local Bus adapters avalable}.\\n Like the Mac, 8-bit SCSI-2 is used as a very fast SCSI-1 by most controllers\\n out there.  Unlike the Mac, IBM has no exact SCSI controller specifications\\n which results in added incompatibilities for SCSI.\\n\\nMac\\nMemory expansion: with a few exceptions the Mac has used non-parity 30-pin \\n 8-bit SIMM memory expansion since the Plus.  While 32-pin 9-bit parity SIMMs\\n could be used in these Macs, only special IIcis could make use of the parity \\n feature {By convension both SIMM types are called 32-pin SIMMs}.  The IIfx \\n used 64-pin parity SIMMs.  The LC III, C610/650 and Q800 all use a new \\n 72-pin SIMM that is accessable by 32-bits at a time and is used in IBMs.\\n The Mac does a complete memory check at startup by writing/reading every\\n memory location; if something is seriously wrong with a SIMM the Mac will\\n not boot and give a sound chord indicating what the problem is.\\n Since Macs made before Feb 15, 1993 managed memory baced on data path, SIMMs \\n had to be installed in pairs {16-bit} or in sets of 4 {32-bit}.  The Centris \\n 650 and Quadra 800 eliminate this with a new memory management setup that \\n allows memory to be upgraded one SIMM at a time.  If the SIMMs are the same \\n size are used then the memory is \\'interleaved\\' across the two SIMMs resulting \\n in a 10-15% performance boost on RAM access (MacWorld Apr 93: 108-109).\\nPrinters, ADBs, and modems: built-in interfaces standard.\\nMonitor interface and sound input: built-in on most present macs. \\nPDS: Available in SE & all present non-Powerbook Macs. 16-bit {SE, \\n Portable, LC, LC II, Classic line} and 32-bit.

Standardized with\\n the LC and 040 bus designs.  With an adapter one NuBus card can be used in \\n IIsi and C610.  Problem: some cards have timing dependency which slows \\n through put down.\\nNuBus Mac II: 32-bit, 10 MHz bus clock, 1-to-1 transaction/bus cycle ratio,\\n and contiguous, hand-shake transactions at ~10-20MB/s; theoretical peak:\\n 40MB/s.  Built-in on all Modular Macs except the LC series, C610, and \\n Performa 400.  The SE/30 could be adapted to use this and there was even a \\n Mac Plus SCSI NuBus.

In development.\\nCPU expansion: handled either through the PDS or the NuBus.  Unlike PDS,  \\n Nubus CPU cards {example-Radius Rocket} allow use of multiple processors at \\n the same time.  This is like having two or more Macs in the same box able to \\n dual task or joinly process depending on the card or software involved {Each \\n NuBus card needs its own memory but most NuBus cards of this type come with \\n 8MB RAM SIMMs on the card standard}.\\n\\nIBM\\nMemory expansion:  parity SIMMs, non-parity SIMMs {some newer models do a Mac-\\nlike SIMM memory check}, or a dozen or so different types of memory boards.\\n\\nHD Interfaces {limited to hard drives by design or lack of development}: \\nMFM:  Modified Frequency Modulation, RLL:  Run Length Limited\\n only used with smaller [² 60mb] hard drives.\\nIDE:  Integrated Device Electronics \\n Asynchronous {~5MB/s max} and synchronous {8.3MB/s max} transfer.\\n currently the most common standard, and is mainly used for medium sized \\n drives.

On older DOS complilers \\nexceptions could cause program aborts; 1/0 and 1/(1/0) would abort to the DOS \\nprompt at the point where they occured.  Most present compilers handle this \\nbetter.  Result: there is little consistent handling of numbers between DOS, \\nWindows and OS/2 programs nor between programs for just one OS.\\n\\nNetworking [Includes printing]\\nWYSIWYG printing can be a problem with either Mac of IBM machines especially \\nif one sends TrueType fonts to a older style PostScript printer.\\nMac\\nHardware: Built-in LocalTalk network port and a built-in printer port.  \\nLocalTalk has moderate speeds (230.4 Kb/s) requires special connectors for \\neach machine ($15 and up) and can be run off of either the printer port {to \\ninclude very old macs} or the network port {standard today}.  Built-in \\nEthernet is becoming common but many older Macs require a PDS or Nubus card at \\nabout $150-$300 for each machine.  These cards provide three connectors and \\ntransceivers {thick, thin, and 10BaseT} for Ethernet.\\nThe Macintosh Quadra family and some Centris models includes Ethernet \\ninterface on motherboard, with transceivers available. TokenRing has been a \\nnetwork option since 1989.\\nSoftware: AppleTalk {the suite of protocols} standard with Mac OS, which can \\nuse variety of media types.  AppleShare client software included with the OS \\nas well and can connect to file servers such as Novell Netware, 3Com 3+Open, \\nBanyan Vines, DEC Pathworks, Apple\\'s AppleShare servers, System 7 File Sharing \\nmachines, and AFP servers running on variety of UNIX hosts.  MacTCP allows \\ntypical TCP/IP communications (telnet, ftp, NFS, rlogin).  A later version \\nwill have Unix X/Open Transport Interface (XTI) built-in by the end of 1993 \\n(MacWeek 04/12/93).  Third-party software to connect to NFS servers.  DEC \\nPathworks provides DECnet support.  Peer-to-peer file sharing software \\nbuilt-in to System 7.1 (See OS section).  Full server software is extra. \\nPrinting requires connection of the printer and the printer being selected in \\nthe chooser.  Changing printers is by selecting a different name in the \\nchooser.  The same is true of connecting to servers.\\nPrinting bugs:  Monaco TrueType font is different then the screen bitmap font.\\n {QuickDraw QX is suppossed to fix this and similar problems.}\\n\\nIBM  \\nHardware: LocalTalk [not widely used], Ethernet,  and TokenRing.\\nSoftware: Novell Netware, Banyan Vines, DECNet, Windows/Work Groups, AppleTalk \\nprotocols, and AppleShare {subset of AppleTalk}.\\nEach of the MS-DOS networking schemes are, in general, totally incompatible \\nwith the others. Once you have chosen one, you are pretty much locked-in to \\nthat product line from then on.  Windows/Work Groups is a little more \\nforgiving and removes some of this problem.  Novell Netware is the biggest, \\n{~80 percent of the corporate market.} and in general is more powerful and \\noffers better control/management/security than AppleShare, but it\\'s also more \\ncomplex to set up and manage.  This will change due to the use of the Mac \\nfinder and file management system by Novell. (PC Week 12/14/92 & 12/28/92;  \\nInfoWorld Dec 14/92; MacWeek 3/22/93)\\nPrinting {Very OS dependent}\\nDOS: If it\\'s a single user, then you plug the printer into the parallel port, \\n and don\\'t worry about it {Tweeking may be needed with poorly written \\n software}.  Network Printing is not controlled by the system, but is mostly \\n implemented by the actual program, therefore performance varies from one \\n software program to the next.\\nWindows 3.x: supports standard drivers and can do a good job of showing \"jobs\" \\n in the print queue, but it always lists printers as \"active\"... even if they \\n are not.  This becomes a problem if there are several incompatible printers \\n on the same net, because there\\'s no way for software to reliably determine \\n which printer is active right now.  Windows for Workgroups is more Mac-like \\n and intelligent about this.\\nOS/2: Mac-like; the os deals with printers, with apps making calls to the OS.\\nPrinting bugs: due to poor programing some programs for all the above OSes do \\nnot have WYSIWYG printing.  This is the fault of the programs in question and \\nnot that of the OS involved.\\n\\nPrice issue: This is very dynamic with Mac providing more build-in features \\nthan IBM and IBM being more \\'get only what you need\\' then Mac and price wars \\nby both worlds.\\nThe IBM machines\\' modualar nature prevents any kind of true hardware \\nstandarization, which in turn requires OSes and programs to be very complex to \\nhandle ALL the variation in hardware.  When one adds all the standard Mac \\nhardware features to an IBM {built-in input/output sound support, SCSI, PDS,  \\nbuilt-in monitor support, built-in networking, standard mouse interface, and \\nNuBus 90 in higher machines} the Mac tends to be cheaper then an equivalent \\nequipted IBM machine {Especially since some IBM monitors can be used with Macs \\nwhich cuts some more of the Mac\\'s cost (MacUser Aug 1992:158-176)}.\\n Some prices using some of the info in this sheet and MacUser April 1993.\\nAll Macs below come with a PDS slot, VRAM, and SCSI-1 built in.

But I\\'ll never\\nforget the night, a year later, when the Oilers closed it out at home in\\nthe pandemonium, the smoke from a million sparklers, the long empty-net\\ngoal near the end, and Dan Kelly letting the crowd\\'s reaction tell the\\nstory for a few long seconds, then that voice barking through the din\\n\"Dave Lumley ... sews it up for Edmonton!\"  It sounds stupid, but that\\nearly (for me) hockey memory will always bring a thrill.  Since then\\nI\\'ve grown a lot more jaded about the game, but I was really saddened\\nby Dan Kelly\\'s passing.  He was one of the good guys.',\n",

       " \"This is turning into a FAQ\\n\\n\\nHere is how to violate your Quadra 700 warranty and install your own\\nmemory.\\n\\n1)  Insert usual disclaimer here\\n \\n2)  Remove the top lid of the machine. You will see the floppy disk and\\n    hard drive mounted in a plastic tower. Follow the usual anti-static\\n    precautions and of course make sure the machine is OFF when you do\\n    this. Unplug the wall and monitor power supply cords from the back\\n\\tof the mac.\\n \\n3)  Remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the\\n    tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up.\\n    The tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the\\n    tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply. You may\\n    also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power\\n    supply. Leave that alone. The plastic tab from the tower is all you\\n    need release.\\n \\n4)  Look at the rear of the tower assembly. You will see the flat ribbon\\n    SCSI connector to the hard drive, a power cable and a flat ribbon cable\\n    leading to the floppy drive. Disconnect all these from the motherboard.\\n    The hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed\\n    to release it.\\n                                            \\n5)  Unplug the drive activity LED from its clear plastic mount\\n\\n6)  Look down the posterior, cylindrical section of the plastic tower. A\\n    phillips head screw is at the base. Remove it, taking care not to drop\\n    it into the case. A bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful\\n    here.\\n\\n7)  Remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the\\n    right side of the tower. This tab prevents the tower from sliding\\n\\tposteriorly. Slide the entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly then\\n\\tlift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case.\\n\\n8)  Congratulations, you have now gained access to your machine's SIMM\\n    slots.\\n\\n9)  The six big slots are for VRAM. One usually must install all six to\\n    gain useful video modes. All SIMMS (RAM or VRAM)  installed with their\\n\\tchips facing the front of the motherboard.\\n\\t\\n    The four smaller sockets in front are for RAM SIMMS. Install SIMMS in\\n\\tsets of four into these sockets. Be sure you seat the SIMMS squarely\\n\\tand firmly into a fully upright position.\\n\\t\\n10) Reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the\\n    tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about\\n\\t1 cm posterior of its intended position. Lower the tower assembly into\\n\\tplace while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case.\\n    Once fully down, slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks\\n    into place.\\n\\t\\n11) Reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables. DONT'T FORGET THE FLOPPY\\n    DRIVE CABLE.\\n\\n12) Replace the phillips head screw\\n\\n13) Drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in.\\n\\n14) Plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount\",\n",
       " \"Can anyone tell me what the difference is between a 256K DRAM chip and a\\n256K SIMM? I need the former (I think) to add memory to my Laserwriter\\nLS.

       " \"\\nLet's start over.  I'm not arguing about who is the better goaltender.  I'd\\ntake Soderstrom right now.  What I am saying is that Roussel can be a #1\\nnetminder.  The GAA difference is less than half a goal per game (less than\\nthat after last night), their save percentages are close, and their records\\nare similar.  And with that, I just don't see how you can label Roussel as\\nthe most disappointing player on the Flyers this season.\\n\\nYou say Soderstrom played against better competition.  That may very well\\nbe, but there is no way of knowing how Roussel would have performed in\\nthose games.  Besides, against the better scoring teams like Pittsburgh,\\nthe defense is more keyed up than they are against San Jose.\\n\\n\\nBut I'm not just judging Roussel on that game alone.  I've seen him play\\nfor the past two seasons in Philly and before that in Hershey.  It's just\\nmy opinion, but I think he's got what it takes.  Of course, I thought that\\nabout Mark LaForest, too.  But I never did about Wendell Young.  So I'm\\nbatting .500 in judging Hershey talent since the Hextall-era.\\n\\nAs for the Rangers game, you can say he was saved by a mistake by the\\noffensive player if you like.  But Rou had his leg in position to make the\\nsave.  If he didn't, it wouldn't have mattered if the Rangers player didn't\\nget the puck up or not.  It would have been a goal.  On a breakaway that's\\nwhat the goalie wants to do, take away as much as possible and force the\\nshooter to beat him.\\n\\n\\nI seem to remember Roussel doing an excellent job against Pittsurgh on\\nopening night to give the Flyers a tie against the two-time defending\\nchamps.  And not to take anything away from Soderstrom because he was\\nsenational in that game agains the Habs.  But you can't tell me that a\\nMontreal player had an open net to shoot at some point during that game\\nand just flat out missed it.  Mistakes, both on offense and defense are\\npart of the game.  Or there'd never be shutouts.\\n\\nAnyway, I'm happy the Flyers have both Soderstrom and Roussel and\\nI'm not going to argue about it anymore.  Besides, with the current\\n7-game winning streak and expectations soaring for next year, I\\ndon't want to piss you off to the point that you don't sell me any\\ntickets next season:-).\",\n",

The FLYERS hit everything that moved. They created scoring chance after\\nscoring chance. They snuffed out everything that the Leafs tried to do.\\n\\nJason Bowen made a good play on his first NHL shift that almost created a goal.\\nHe had the puck in the top of the left offensive circle all alone, but instead\\nof taking the shot he found Brind\\'Amour crashing the net on the other side.\\nA perfect pass and a good shot across Daren Puppa\\'s body should have been a\\ngoal, but Puppa made a great save reading the play.\\n\\nGarry Galley gave the Maple Leafs 7th ranked power play the first chance when\\nhe hooked Doug Gilmour at 4:25. The FLYERS lowly 21st ranked penalty killing\\nunit was almost flawless the entire game, and set the tone on this kill. The\\nMaple Leafs got almost nothing but long unscreened shots, and the defense swept\\naway every rebound.\\n\\nAfter the power play, the FLYERS got a goal on an ugly play. Rod Brind\\'Amour\\ngave the puck to Greg Hawgood at the right point, and he sent a drive at the\\nnet. Puppa made the save and kicked the rebound right into the feet of Josef\\nBeranek and Bob Rouse, who were wrestling in the slot. Beranek was able to\\nget his stick on the puck and push it out to Dineen who was skating into\\nthe slot from the right circle, and he lifted a backhander over Puppa for\\na 1-0 FLYERS lead at 8:10.\\n\\nThe FLYERS kept the pressure on, and Puppa was the only Leaf keeping the FLYERS\\nfrom building on their lead for a while. Eventually things settled down and\\ndefense prevailed. Each team got an occasional scoring chance, but the goalies\\nwere strong. Bowen started giving some Lindros-like checks in his own corners.\\nThen Lindros, who was looking to avenge a hit Foligno gave him, thought he had\\na chance to even the score. He had Foligno lined up at center ice, leaned into\\nhim, and rode him into the center ice boards. The only problem was that Foligno\\nwas a little far from the boards, and Mike \"Mister\" McGeough felt that it\\nwarranted a boarding call at 15:38\\n\\nThe Leafs couldn\\'t get anything going on the power play as the FLYERS were\\nvery aggressive (for a change) on the kill.\\n\\nWith time running out in the period, Recchi carried through the neutral zone\\nand handed to Lindros as they approached the Leaf\\'s blue line. They were in\\na crowd with Wendell Clark and Jamie Macoun, Lindros tried a backhand pass\\nto Recchi through the feet of Macoun that connected to Recchi, but then Clark\\nchecked Recchi off the puck. Macoun then tried to clear, but it was weak and\\nwent right to McGill who had manned the point. He drove it from just inside\\nthe blue line. Macoun got his stick on it and deflected it past his own\\ngoalie at 19:55.1. Shots were 13-8 FLYERS in the period.\\n\\nThe FLYERS finally got their first chance on the power play when Dave Andreychuk\\ntripped up Rod Brind\\'Amour in his offensive zone. During the power play, the\\nFLYERS got cheated a little when the puck popped up into the air and Eric\\ngloved it down, but McGeough thought it hit his stick above his head. We\\ncould see from our seats at the other end of the ice that it only hit his glove\\nand the replay confirmed, but the faceoff went to the other end. As time was\\nrunning out in the advantage, Lindros found Galley with a pass across the goal\\nmouth but Puppa made the save. The rebound kicked back to the right corner where\\nRecchi picked it up, passed it out to Eric crashing through the right circle,\\nand Eric one-timed past Puppa at 7:55. With the assist, Recchi moves past\\nBobby Clarke\\'s 74-75 season, the second best one season total for a FLYER at\\n117.  Eric moves up to 4th all time in FLYERS rookie scoring with 67 points.\\n\\nMike Eastwood took down Al Conroy at 8:30 to give the FLYERS another chance on\\nthe power play. Not much pressure before Garry Galley ended the power play with\\na slash at 9:19. Not much happened on the 4 on 4, although the Leafs had most\\nof the possession. The FLYERS smothered the Leafs short power play. Tempers\\nflared a little at 13:14. Bowen and Pearson got roughing minors, Keith Acton\\ngot a bloody face. Dave McLlwain then took a dive and got Greg Hawgood a\\nhooking minor at 13:46 to set up a 4 on 3. The replay showed that Hawgood\\'s\\nstick stopped making contact with McLlwain long before he spun around and fell.\\nAgain the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play, led by Dimitri Yushkevich.\\nBowen made a thundering hit when he came out of the box on Pearson. Berehowski\\ntried to perplex everybody with his sloooowball. He had the puck at the point,\\nand just trickled a pass down the slot. He made all the FLYERS look silly as\\nnobody could get a stick on it, and it got to Gilmour at the side of the net,\\nbut Soderstrom stoned him.\\n\\nThe FLYERS picked things up offensively after the kill was over, but didn\\'t\\nget anything home. Shots were 13-10 FLYERS.\\n\\nThe FLYERS were content with the 3 goal lead in the third period, and they\\ndecided that if Tommy wanted a shutout, he was going to have to work for it a\\nlittle.\\n\\nThe FLYERS got most of the scoring chances in the first 7 or so minutes of the\\nperiod, but couldn\\'t get past Puppa. Then the Leafs got tired of Lindros making\\nroad kill out of them, and tempers flared. 2 each for Doug Gilmour and Lindros \\n(unsportsmanlike conduct) and 2 each for Glenn Anderson and McGill (roughing)\\nall at 7:02. Terry Carkner then took a kneeing penalty at 7:51 on Gilmour.\\n\\nAgain the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play.\\n\\nAt about the 12 minute mark, Dave Andreychuk got a shot away from his left\\ncircle that got through Soderstrom. The puck was rolling on it\\'s side, and\\nas luck would have it it turned away from the net instead of turning towards\\nit (think of how a rolling quarter inevitably starts to lean one way or the\\nother). Seconds later Rod Brind\\'Amour tripped up Gilmour at 12:24 to give the\\nLeafs another chance on the power play. On the advantage, after Soderstrom\\nstoned Andreychuk while lying down, Andreychuk got the rebound through\\nSoderstrom, but from behind the net and it went straight through and was swept\\naway by one of his defensemen. They kept the pressure on, but Soderstrom was\\nequal and preserved the shutout.\\n\\nRecchi cross checked Ken Baumgartner to get tempers hot and start a brawl\\nat 16:01. No punches thrown, Recchi got the initial minor, Krushelnyski\\nBaumgartner and Lindros each got roughing minors. At 17:02 Rouse and Beranek\\nexpressed their mutual dislike for each other and got 2 each for slashing to\\nset up another 4 on 4. Mike Eastwood shoved down Ryan McGill in the FLYERS\\nzone as they were battling for the puck, and while McGill was down he ran\\nhis stick across McGill\\'s face. The FLYERS were not happy with that at all.\\n5-8 Al Conroy paired up with 6-1 Berehowski, and started throwing punches.\\nUpward. Well, Al held his own, much to the delight of the crowd. Each got\\na couple punches in before going down in a head, and Al got a standing O!\\nPenalties: Eastwood 5 (cross check) + game, Clark, Carkner 10 each. Berehowski\\nand Conroy 5 each (fighting) at 17:49.\\n\\nSo a major penalty for the rest of the game for the FLYERS. The had no interest\\nin stting on the lead. Hawgood, Galley and Brind\\'Amour played catch until\\nHawgood found Dineen all alone in the left circle, he controlled the puck and\\nblasted it past Puppa at 18:39.\\n\\nThat was all the fireworks, Tommy Soderstrom would not face another shot. Puppa\\ndid, but kept the FLYERS off the board. 4-0 FLYERS, shots were 9-8 FLYERS in the\\n3rd. Probably the strongest game I\\'ve seen from the FLYERS since the All Star\\nbreak. Shutout number 4 for Soderstrom, all since 1/10. Tied for 2nd most in\\nthe NHL, but he\\'s played fewer games than Belfour (6) or the goalie I can\\'t\\nremember that he\\'s tied with.\\n\\nNext up it\\'s the Winnipeg Selannes Tuesday night in Winnipeg. The FLYERS cannot\\nbe eliminated if they win, but a loss coupled with an Islander win that night\\nin Washington would be the official end.\\n\\nFLYERS up to 71 points on the season in 78 games. Last year they had 75 points\\nin 80 games (5 under .500), so they need at least 8 points in their last 6\\ngames to improve on that only by percentage points (5 under in 84 is better\\nthan 5 under in 80).\\n\\nTragic number holds at 3 points with 6 games left. The tragic number for 5th\\nis 5 points, I watched the Rangers blow a 4-2 third period lead at home to\\nlose 5-4 before I finished this up. Why 5 points instead of 4? Well, the FLYERS\\nwill win the tie-breaker if they catch them, whereas the Islanders win tie\\nbreakers against the FLYERS and so need only a tie. The Rangers could crumble\\ndown the stretch as they play the Devils, the Pens twice, the FLYERS, and\\nfinish up with 2 games against the Caps. So I guess 5th place could be the\\ngoal for the team to focus on.\\n\\nFLYERS team record watch:\\n\\nEric Lindros:\\n\\n38 goals, 29 assists, 67 points\\n\\n(rookie records)\\nclub record goals:\\t\\t\\tclub record points:\\nEric Lindros\\t38 1992-93\\t\\tDave Poulin\\t76 1983-84\\nBrian Propp\\t34 1979-80\\t\\tBrian Propp\\t75 1979-80\\nRon Flockhart\\t33 1981-82\\t\\tRon Flockhart\\t72 1981-82\\nDave Poulin\\t31 1983-84\\t\\tEric Lindros\\t67 1992-93\\nBill Barber\\t30 1972-73\\t\\tPelle Eklund\\t66 1985-86\\n\\nMark Recchi:\\n\\n51 goals, 66 assists, 117 points.\\n\\nclub record goals:\\t\\t\\tclub record points:\\nReggie Leach\\t61 1975-76\\t\\tBobby Clarke\\t119 1975-76\\nTim Kerr\\t58 1985-86,86-87\\tMark Recchi\\t117 1992-93\\nTim Kerr\\t54 1983-84,84-85\\tBobby Clarke\\t116 1974-75\\nMark Recchi\\t51 1992-93\\t\\tBill Barber\\t112 1975-76\\nRick Macliesh\\t50 1972-73\\t\\tBobby Clarke\\t104 1972-73\\nBill Barber\\t50 1975-76\\t\\tRick Macliesh\\t100 1972-73\\nReggie Leach\\t50 1979-80\\n\\nFLYERS career years:\\n\\nPlayer\\t\\tPoints\\tBest Prior Season\\nMark Recchi\\t117\\t113 (90-91 Penguins)\\nRod Brind\\'Amour\\t79\\t77 (91-92 FLYERS)\\nGarry Galley\\t58\\t38 (84-85 Kings)\\nBrent Fedyk\\t58\\t35 (90-91 Red Wings)\\n\\nThat\\'s all for now...',\n",

My father did radio\\nplay by play for the local team, the Trail Smokeaters, who by  the way, were\\nthe last Canadian team to win the World Championship (back in 1961).

Both my kids play for\\nthe Santa Clara Valley Hockey Association and this season, which just ended,\\ncost me $75 per kid for membership in Hockey USA, plus $750 per kid for club\\ndues.  The Hockey USA fees cover excess medical insurance, and the club dues\\ncover ice time, officials, trophies, etc.  Other areas have similar fees, unless\\nthe city government subsidises some of the costs, as Stockton does.\\n\\nBy the way; most ice arenas are located in what could be called the \"inner city\"\\nareas.  Eastridge and Vallco are exceptions ...

The kiddie quartet of Sanderson, Poulin, Nylander, and\\nPetrovicky have been attracting the most attention, but Cassels is just 23\\nand will score close to 90 points this season. He has quite nicely assumed the\\nrole of number one center on the team and works very well with Sanderson. Yake\\nbounced around the minors for a number of seasons but is still 24 and will put\\nup about 20 goals and 50 points this season. Yake, like Sanderson, started\\nperforming better offensively once he was converted from center to wing, \\nalthough lefty Sanderson went to the left wing and righty Yake went to the\\nright side.\\n\\nBiggest disappointment: Hands down, John Cullen. Cullen had a disasterous 77\\npoint season last year, his first full season after The Trade. Cullen started\\nthe season off of summer back surgery, and fell flat on his face (appropriate,\\nsince he spent all of his Whaler career flat on his ass, and whining about it).\\nCullen scored just 9 point on 19 games, was a clubhouse malcontent, commanded\\nthe powerplay to a 9% success percentage (>21% with Sanderson), and sulked his\\nway out of town. Worst of all, his 4 year, $4M contract had three years left\\nto run, so no one would give up any more than the 2nd round draft pick the \\nMaple Leafs offered to Hartford. Honorable mention: Steve Konroyd, also subpar\\nafter signing a 3 year, $2.1M contract; Eric Weinrich, who showed flashes of\\ncompetence, but overall has played poorly; Jim McKenzie, who was a much better\\nhockey player two seasons ago than he is now; and Frank Pietrangelo, who only\\nseemed to play well when Sean Burke was out for an extended period and he got\\nto make a number of starts in a row.',\n",

And that kind of invisibility was prevalent for the most part\\nfor DePalma.  After being called up October 30 against the Tampa Bay Lightning,\\nDePalma had an excellent week, scoring 5 points in 3 games while playing good\\ndefense.  Unfortunately, the 27-year-old DePalma then disappeared the rest of\\nthe way, getting just 3 more points in 15 more games, and generally looked\\nlethargic and uninterested on both ends of the ice.  He then was sent down to\\nKansas City, walked out from there, and was suspended and later reinstated\\nwhen it was revealed that he was injured; he then promptly disappeared from\\nthe watching eyes of Shark Bytes (as the mailing list is now known to Sharks\\nofficials) faithful, and neither the Sharks nor we miss him.\\n\\n#10\\tJOHAN GARPENLOV\\t\\tSeason: 3rd\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, trade with Detroit for D Bob McGill and 8th round\\n\\t\\tpick in \\'92 entry draft from Vancouver\\nGrade:\\t\\tA/A-\\n\\nAfter an early slump, Garpenlov was nothing short of inspirational the rest\\nof the way, finishing with 66 points in 79 games, second highest total on the\\nteam, as he clicked well with team MVP Kelly Kisio and right wing Rob\\nGaudreau.  Kisio got most of the credit, but Garpenlov, finishing second in\\nthe MVP voting, clearly demonstrated his playmaking and scoring skills, as he\\nwas seen making excellent centering passes as well as finishing passes to him\\nby putting the puck past opposing goaltenders, getting a club-high 14 power-\\nplay goals.  Contrary to his previous rep, Garpenlov also showed that despite\\nhis small size (5\\' 11\", 183 lbs.), he was willing to throw himself around\\nwhen necessary, albeit not very successful yet.  He also still needs to work\\non his defense, although he improved tremendously throughout the season, and\\nwas actually quite a good penalty killer by the end of the season.  He will\\nbe a major key to the offense next year.\\n\\n#15\\tDAVID BRUCE\\t\\tSeason: 5th\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from St. Louis in expansion draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (?)\\n\\nAfter a banner \\'91-92, when he led the team in power-play goals (10) and\\nwas third in total scoring (38 points in 60 games), Bruce was bothered\\nvirtually all of this season with a groin injury, which kept him out of the\\nlineup for all by 17 games this season.  Of course, it is difficult to\\nspeculate how well he would have done this season had he not been affected by\\nthe injury, but the 28-year-old Bruce was effective with a man up or a man\\nshort in the Sharks\\' first season, and was expected to be a strong offensive\\nleader this season as well.  The injury appears serious, which is a shame,\\nbecause otherwise he may have a much brighter future for now; instead, his\\nfuture with the Sharks next season appears clouded.\\n\\n#18\\tMARK PEDERSON\\t\\tSeason:\\t3rd\\nAcquired:\\t\\'92-93, trade with Philadelphia for C/LW Dave Snuggerud\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (B)\\n\\nIt is difficult for me to understand the Flyers\\' decision to unload Pederson,\\nafter a very good offensive season last season (40 points in 58 games), but\\nafter riding the pine early in the season, Pederson was summarily sent to the\\nSharks in exchange of the defensive-minded Snuggerud, and he finished with\\n41 games combined with the Flyers and the Sharks.  He was also limited by\\ninjuries this season, and this limited his production (17 points).  But when\\nhealthy, Pederson appears impressive, with a good scoring touch, good size\\n(and the willingness to throw it around, although he\\'s not considered a\\nphysical forward), and good speed.  He also does not appear to be a liability\\non defense, but the Sharks probably have to wait until next season to see how\\nmuch, exactly, Pederson can do.\\n\\n#20\\tJOHN CARTER\\t\\tSeason: 4th\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, free agent from Boston\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (B+/B)\\n\\nCarter was definitely one of the hardest workers on the team, and the hard\\nwork worked wonders, as at times he looked great on ice.  However, although he\\ndid look great at times, the fact that he received just 16 points (in 55\\ngames) for his efforts is a sign that there is only so much his hard work can\\ndo, and the Sharks confirmed that by sending him to Kansas City with about\\n20 games left in the season.  Carter, who will turn 30 on May 6, always\\nhussled, but as a result, was sometimes trapped too deep within the offensive\\nzone while forechecking, but he was generally a credit on the defensive end,\\nbut he is probably of limited utility in that capacity, and he did not impress\\noffensively, although he was one of the best Sharks at drawing penalties.  He\\nis very unlikely to be back next season.\\n\\n#28\\tJEAN-FRANCOIS QUINTIN\\tSeason: 1st\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (B+/B)\\n\\nI don\\'t understand why the Sharks didn\\'t let Quintin play any more than the\\n14 games he played this season.  He was generally hard-working and creating\\nopportunities offensively, and appeared, at age 23, ready for regular NHL\\nduty, at least for a team like the Sharks, finishing with 7 points in those\\n14 games while not being a defensive liability.  Shoulder injury in training\\ncamp before the \\'91-92 season limited Quintin, the team\\'s leading scorer in\\nexhibition games despite sitting out the final two, to just 29 games with the\\nSharks and the Blades that season, but he looked impressive.  He should be a\\nsolid contender for regular duty next season.\\n\\n#41\\tMARK BEAUFAIT\\t\\tSeason: 1st\\nAcquired:\\t2nd round pick in 1991 supplemental draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (?)\\n\\nAfter a all-star season at Kansas City, Beaufait got a cup of coffey with the\\nSharks late in the season when the Blades knocked down a playoff spot and the\\nSharks decimated with injuries, playing 5 games and scoring a goal for his only\\nNHL point thus far.  Despite small size (5\\' 9\", 165 lbs.), Beaufait was not shy\\nto throw himself around when necessary, and looked pretty good at times,\\nalthough it\\'s too early to judge him based on 5 NHL games, in which he played\\nmostly left wing, away from his center position at Northern Michigan and\\nKansas City.\\n\\n#42\\tJAROSLAV OTEVREL\\tSeason: 1st\\nAcquired:\\t8th round pick in 1991 entry draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (?)\\n\\nLike Beaufait, Otevrel also played away from his normal position when he was\\nup for his cup of tea (7 games) midway through the season.  He was generally\\nvery much of a defensive liability, and did not show much offensively either,\\nalthough that may be more indicative of the lack of ice time he got in those\\n7 games.  He may need another season to work on his defense, but once his\\ndefense is acceptable, he should be ready.\\n\\n#44\\tMICHEL PICARD\\t\\tSeason: 1st\\nAcquired:\\t\\'92-93, trade with Hartford for LW Yvon Corriveau\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (B-/C+)\\n\\nThe 23-year-old Picard, although he perennially tore up the minors, seems to\\nbe close to being out of chances, for some reason, after being acquired by the\\nSharks but failing to impress the management in 25 games, scoring 4 goals for\\nhis only points, and he spent most of the rest of the way in Kansas City.\\nHe was not particularly strong defensively, and despite his offensive\\nbrilliance in the minors, he has failed thus far to score in the NHL, although\\nhe has been given limited opportunities.  He may be the Sharks\\' bait in the\\nexpansion draft.\\n\\n#45\\tDODY WOOD\\t\\tSeason: 1st\\nAcquired:\\t3rd round pick in 1991 entry draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (D+/D, although perhaps I shouldn\\'t give a grade at all)\\n\\nI have been accused of knocking on Wood too much. :-)  Then, it is probably\\nno surprise to you that I am thoroughly unimpressed by Wood thus far, although\\n13 games is a small example.  He was generally a nonfactor on offense, was\\nnot particularly good defensively, and took too many silly penalties, losing\\nmany fights in the process and gathering 69 penalty minutes in those 13 games,\\nprojecting to to 446(!) in an 84-game season.  He\\'s not ready, and needs at\\nleast another season at KC, where he can work on his fighting skills, if\\nnothing else.  His relatively small size (5\\' 11\", 181 lbs.) does not give much\\npossibility that he can survive, at this stage, as an enforcer.',\n",

But, at best, he's\\nonly a mediocre goaltender.

But he, playing the first part of this season in Kansas City,\\nwas good neither offensively nor defensively this year; it, then, appears that\\n\\'91-92 was a fluke.  Although he improved towards the end of the season, he\\nwas prone to being out of position defensively, and did not demonstrate the\\nplaymaking skills that made him the team\\'s leading scorer among defensemen last\\nyear.  He would also be hardpressed to make the team next year.\\n\\n#4\\tJAYSON MORE\\t\\tSeason: 2nd\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from Montreal in expansion draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tB+\\n\\nAfter being touted as the team\\'s top defensive prospects in training camp\\nbefore \\'91-92, More had a rather disappointing \\'91-92, as he was not\\nparticularly good defensively, and had just 17 points in 46 games.  He, then,\\nproceeded to improve his game massively this season, becoming the team\\'s most\\nreliable defenseman, whom the team can count on night in and night out to play\\nsteady defense and providing occasional (but only occasional) offensive flash.\\nOffensively, he was even more disappointing than last year (11 points in 73\\ngames), but his defense improved tremendously.  He is probably best as the\\ndefensive part of a defense combination with an offensive defenseman.\\n\\n#5\\tNEIL WILKINSON\\t\\tSeason: 4th\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tB-\\n\\nWilkinson was probably the team\\'s top defensive defenseman in \\'91-92.  However,\\npartially because of injuries, he was not the same this year, as he missed 25\\ngames total due to nagging knee and back injuries, and seemed to be slowed\\neven when playing.  He, then, had often to be saved by his defensive partners;\\nthat is, if they are there at all.  But he also had some solid games, and if\\nhe can be complete healthy, he can still be a force.\\n\\n#6\\tSANDIS OZOLINSH\\t\\tSeason: 1st\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, 2nd round pick in entry draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (A)\\n\\nAt the time of his injury (December 30, against the Philadelphia Flyers),\\nOzolinsh was well on track to be, IMO, the team\\'s MVP.  A serious knee injury\\nin that game, though, forced him to miss the rest of the season (47 games),\\nbut he still finished as the team\\'s top scorer among defensemen (23 points),\\nwhich, of course, tells more about the lack of offense the Sharks had from\\ntheir defensemen, but it also tells of Ozolinsh\\'s abilities.  At the time, he\\nwas playing very good defense along with excellent offense; he was still\\nsusceptible to so-called \"rookie mistakes,\" but was probably the defenseman who\\nmade the least of them on the team, rookie or veteran.  If he can come back\\nfrom his injuries, he is ready to be a star.\\n\\n#19\\tDOUG ZMOLEK\\t\\tSeason: 1st\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tB\\n\\nZmolek had basically a solid and durable year, being one of the only two Sharks\\nto play in all 84 games of the season.  He was solid on defense, but\\nafter being billed as an offensive defenseman, he didn\\'t show it (15 points).\\nHe was also prone to penalties, and his 229 penalty minutes was second on the\\nteam; however, that was also an indication that he was fearly when facing tough\\nphysical opponents, and he was at his best when playing physically.

Too slow!)\\n\\nSo I tried the following scheme: For an n-megabyte transfer, \\n\\nStep 1:                                Load the 1st MB from disk to buffer.\\nStep 2: Asynch send 1st MB out card,   Load the 2nd MB from disk to buffer.\\nStep 3: Asynch send 2nd MB out card,   Load the 3rd MB from disk to buffer.\\n        ...\\nStep n: Asynch send the n-1 MB out card, Load the nth MB from disk to buffer.\\nStep n+1: Send the nth MB out card.\\n\\nEven though the code apparently does execute the card transfer asynchronously,\\nand the card does not use the Mac cpu at all,  (It is using the buffer, tho')\\neach of the steps 2 through n take as long as if the two transfers were\\nexecuted one after another.  So there is no improvement in the rate.\\n\\nWhy?\\n\\nIs the mac RAM dual-port?  (So the NuBus card and the disk driver can both\\naccess data at the same time.)\\nIs the problem that the two devices, card and disk driver, both have to use\\nthe same bus to mac RAM?\\n\\nIs there anything I can do?\",\n",

These guys always suck wind in the 2nd period,\\ncome on a little in the 3rd and run out of gas too soon.  It is unbelieveable\\nhow many one goal games these guys have lost.  Anyway, the games was pretty \\nwide open.  The Isles still have tons of trouble scoring.  The Whalers played \\na golie in is 1st NHL start, I think his name was Lenarduzzi (sp?).  (His NHL \\ndebut was the Tuesday tie against the Isles).  Like I mentioned before, this \\nguy looked like the best golie on the planet for a while (until he misplayed a \\nMahlakov slap shot to go to OT).  I say it\\'s because the Isles don\\'t shoot \\ncorrectly.  Has anyone else noticed this?\\n\\n\\tAlso, I think it is really a shame for hockey when I guy like Mick\\nVukota gets as much ice time as he does.  This guy has about as much hockey\\ntalent as Jiggs MacDonald (who did play hockey, I think).  Anytime he gets the\\npuck it gets stolen, and he always starts fights and gets needless penalties. \\nRichard Pilon is another guy who is on the ice to stir up crap.  And he\\'s a\\ndefenseman.  He\\'s got to be approaching negative infinity for his plus/minus. \\nThis guy gets beaten all the time.  Why the need for such \"enforcers\"?

I\\'ll be one of the few to admit, I do enjoy a \\ngood fight once in a while, but only when it\\'s \"called for\".  You know, when a\\nguy checks the goalie too hard.

The Mac has a sizeable share of the typesetting market, as in the U.S. A local magazine, Next Magazine (similar to Newsweek here), uses the Mac extensively. I have seen Sir Speedy and other franchises in Hong Kong equipped with Mac-based systems. True, the discount is not as steep as here because customers in Hong Kong cannot buy from gray market, nor are Mac being sold thru mass merchandisers like Apple does here with the Performa lin\\n\\n\\ne. At this point the sale of Mac is handled by one exclusive distributor. On the other hand, you can always get a PC clone or in the earlier days, illegal clones of the Apple IIe.\\n\\nYour perception of the Mac not being too popular in Hong Kong is simply because most hobbyists and users find it much cheaper to go to one of those basement stores that sell PC clones with probably illegal copies of BIOS than to pay for a Mac.\\n\\nSimilarly you cannot say Lotus 1-2-3 surely is not well accepted in Hong Kong because the sale is so low. May be it is because of all those places in Kowloon where illegal copies of Lotus 1-2-3 can be bought for $20 and $10 for a professional looking but illegal copies of the manuals.',\n",

In fact, one of the notes from sumex on fixing\\nthe trackball advocates sliding the roller so that its _edge_ contacts the\\nball, not the center cylindrical area.\\n\\nI've done this with my PB100, and it does seem to improve the feel, but\\nneeds to be adjusted from time to time. I just popped open one of our\\noffice's PB170s, and while there isn't as much latitude for movement, one\\ncould still adjust the roller slightly. If your PB140 is the same it might\\nhelp.\\n\\nI would suspect the most likely culprit to be a slippery blue roller. If\\nyou can take it out, clean it with a mild soapy solution, or isopropyl \\nalcohol. Also, be sure the ball is grease-free.\\n\\nIf you drop the ball in minus the retaining ring, roll the ball and see\\nif it is actually causing the axle to spin. \\n\\nIf all this still doesn't solve it, then maybe a new one is in order. :-(\\nIt could be an electrical connection, in which case replacement would be\\nnecessary. But my experience with both mice and trackballs has been that\\ndirt has been the normal problem, not an electrical malfunction.\\n\\nHope this helps,\\n\\nMurray\\n \\n\",\n",

       " 'To those who are wondering what is happening in Minnesota:\\n\\n  From what I have seen in the local news (TV and newspaper), various people \\nin the area are trying to get a new hockey team.  A columnist for the St. \\nPaul \"Pioneer Press\" wrote an article giving the \"inside scoop\" on the \\nissue.  There are three local sites competing for a team and three possible \\ncandiates to move to the Twin Cities.  First the sites: Target Center, Civic \\nCenter (St. Paul), and yes, even the Met Center.  The columnist was pretty \\nconfident that Minnesota will get a team, and that the Target Center will \\nultimately win out.  He argued, however, that the competition from the other \\ntwo sites will delay the process considerably.  Without the \\ninter-site competition, the columnist (sorry, I can\\'t remember his name) \\nbelieves that Minnesota would have a team by the 1994-95 season.  Also, \\nbecause of the situation with the Timberwolves, things will be delayed \\nuntil (unless) the city of Minneapolis takes over the Target Center.  \\nHowever, they are unlikely to do so until the Met Center is destroyed, \\nbecause the city will lose money if there is competition from the Met for \\nconventions and short-term events (even with hockey at Target).  To add to \\nthis mess, a STUDY (6 to 12 months) is going to be conducted on the future \\nviability of the Met Center, which obviously delays the process even \\nfurther.  I hope that the study is cancelled, which will have the effect of \\nknocking the Met Center out of the running and perhaps encouraging \\nMinneapolis to take over the Target Center sooner.

The OT game winner came from Dimitri\\nYushkevich, just his 5th of the season and his first game winner. The FLYERS\\nnever led up until that point in the game. For the Whalers, the loss marked an\\nNHL record 9th OT loss this season.\\n\\nRoster move:\\n\\nGord Hynes was called to to play in place of Ryan McGill\\n\\nInjuries:\\n\\nRyan McGill injured his hand in a fight 4/15 and was scratched.\\n\\nLines:\\n\\nEklund-Lindros-Recchi\\nBeranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen\\nLomakin-Butsayev-Conroy\\nFaust-Acton-Brown\\n\\nGalley-Bowen\\nYushkevich-Hawgood\\nCarkner-Hynes\\n\\nDominic Roussel\\n\\nGame Summary:\\n\\nI didn't get TV coverage of the game, and since it was stormy in these parts\\nI didn't have the best radio coverage either. Here's the box score followed by\\na few things I did pick up:\\n\\nFirst Period:\\n\\tHartford, Nylander 10, 8:51\\n\\tPhiladelphia, Recchi 53 (Lindros, Brind'Amour), 19:59.8 (pp)\\nPenalties - Verbeek, Har (holding), :55; Carkner, Phi (roughing), 13:53; Houda,\\nHar (interference) 18:43\\n\\nSecond Period:\\n\\tHartford, Burt 6 (Cunneyworth, Kron), 2:00\\n\\tPhiladelphia, Bowen 1 (Eklund, Recchi), 7:09\\n\\tHartford, Nylander 11 (Zalapski, Sanderson), 9:38\\nPenalties - Galley, Phi, major-game misconduct (spearing) :58; Verbeek, Har\\nmajor-game misconduct (spearing), :58; Brown, Phi (tripping), 3:22; Zalapski,\\nHar (tripping), 15:51; Brind'Amour, Phi (slashing), 19:50\\n\\nThird Period:\\n\\tHartford, Kron 14 (Sanderson, Cassels), 1:24 (pp)\\n\\tPhiladelphia, Beranek 15 (Lomakin, Yushkevich), 3:11\\n\\tPhiladelphia, Faust 2 (Brind'Amour, Roussel), 3:38\\nPenalties - Houda, Har (tripping), 4:20; Hawgood, Phi (holding), 5:30\\n\\nOvertime:\\n\\tPhiladelphia, Yushkevich 5 (Faust), 1:15.\\nPenalties - None\\n\\nPower Play:\\n\\tPhiladelphia 1 of 4, Hartford 1 of 4\\n\\nGoalies:\\n\\tPhiladelphia, Roussel 14-11-5 (30 shots - 26 saves)\\n\\tHartford, Lenarduzzi, 1-1-1 (38 - 33)\\n\\nOn the first Hartford goal, Gord Hynes misplayed the puck at the FLYERS blue\\nline and Nylander stripped him and took off.\\n\\nThe Recchi goal was a 2 on 1 with Lindros.\\n\\nThe Bowen goal was just a puck he threw at the net, got a good carom and it\\nended up behind the goalie.\\n\\nOn the second Nylander goal he got three whacks at the puck before it went in.\\nThis is the most frustrating part of the FLYERS defense. Take the body, and if\\nthey get one shot and beat you fine. Don't give them another chance. Carkner,\\nGalley and McGill are all terrible about this, I'll bet money at least one of\\nthem was the closest FLYER to the play.\\n\\nThat's all I have, my radio got bad after that and I was lucky to know who it\\nwas that scored, much less how.\\n\\nFrom what I heard, Roussel had a very strong game. After the game, Gene Hart\\nasked Bobby Taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of the\\ngame. It was Garry Galley #3 for his career high point total (I'm surprised\\nthat a former goalie wouldn't look closer at his defensive play), Tommy \\nSoderstrom #2 for his team record tying 5 shutouts in only about 1/2 a season\\nand, Mark Recchi #1 for his all time high team single season scoring mark.\\nBut here's the odd part. He couldn't decide between Lindros and Recchi for\\nnumber 1. If he picks Recchi as #1 after he had a hard time choosing between\\nhim and Lindros, doesn't that make Lindros #2????\\n\\nWhat? You wanna know my three stars of the season? Well, since you asked...\\n\\n#1 Eric Lindros. Eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice.\\nThe difference between the team's record with him and without him is no\\naccident. I believe that the team could have been almost as successful without\\nRecchi. There is no question that this team is significantly better with Eric\\nLindros on it, and I think that he will deservedly wear the 'C' on his jersey\\nnext season.\\n\\n#2 Tommy Soderstrom. 5 shutouts was second in the league to only Ed Belfour,\\nand Tommy didn't have a Chris Chelios (booo) in front of him. He also didn't\\nplay a complete season due to heart problems (sentimental edge here, my family\\nhas a history of heart problems). There's no question in my mind that Tommy\\nSoderstrom is this teams goalie of the future, and if Roussel complains again\\nabout being number 2 look for him to be traded within 2 years.\\n\\n#3 Mark Recchi. Again, you can't argue with an all-time team high single season\\nscoring mark. There are an awful lot of teams that didn't have a single player\\nget as many points. Plus, Mark is the only FLYER to play the entire season.\\nNot a tough choice.\\n\\nHonorable mentions: Rod Brind'Amour topped his single season high point total\\nwhich he set last year. The difference was that he wasn't on the top line\\nthis year and didn't get as much playing time. Then again, he didn't get the\\ndefensive attention that he got last year from the other team either.\\n\\nDimtri Yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman. Yes, he made rookie\\nmistakes, but he was usually fast enough to make up for them. I have a feeling\\nthat with his shot he'll score a few more points next year without giving up\\nanything in his own zone, and I suspect that he'll be the teams top defenseman\\nin years to come.\\n\\nGarry Galley was the team's point leader from defensemen. Again, there are some\\nthings you just can't argue with. And he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome,\\nhe certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game, and that was against his\\nwishes under doctors orders. But his defensive play often negates his offensive\\ncontribution. A little more caution, and a little bit smarter in his own end\\nwill make him a much more important part of the team next year.\\n\\nBrent Fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total.\\nBut consistency became a problem for him.\\n\\nA couple misc notes mostly for mailing list members:\\n\\nTom Misnik, a member of the mailing list, would like to exchange E-mail\\naddresses with any list members who want to keep in touch over the summer.\\nIf you're interested, you can send him mail at:\\n\\natt!ACR.ORG!TMISNIK\\n\\nThe FLYERS end the season 1 game below .500 in 5th place, their best winning\\npercentage since going .500 in 1988-89. 14-20-3 within the division (4th in\\nPatrick), 23-14-5 at home.

I stand by that assessment.\\nHe was a very good player who belongs in the hall of fame.  Did you\\never watch him play? He never made a technical error.\\n\\n[more nonsense deleted]\\n\\n\\nTo knowledgeable observers of the game my meaning is obvious.  Your\\nhockey education is not my responsibility.\\n \\n\\nHe was just another player.  To laud him as anything more I find\\nbothersome.  I hated the Habs.  I hated Lafleur until I realized\\nthat he was likely the most aesthetically pleasing player to ever \\nskate in my lifetime.  Why would anyone talk about Gainey?\\n  \\n\\n\\nDid he play hockey at a high level?  Was he any good?  If not, why\\nwould you bother to bring JC up?  I am talking about hockey players\\nhere.  If you can\\'t follow the conversation don\\'t follow up.  As I\\nsaid previously, it is not my responsibility to educate you.\\n\\n\\nSure.  Two journeymen.  Big deal.  Neither one of them is worth\\ndiscussing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThat is an excellent idea and if I decide to waste any more time\\nresponding to any of your, or Greg\\'s, postings then I will be sure\\nto implement that very macro.\\n \\n\\nTarasov claimed that Gainey was a \"hockey god.\"  And Greg ate it up.\\nAnd that is what this thread is all about.  If you didn\\'t know \\nthat then why are you responding?\\n\\nAnd as for \"blanket disregard for these individuals\", I can remember \\nLeaf teams, purely populated by such \"individuals\", winning four \\nStanley Cups.  Teams.  No one ran around telling us that George\\nArmstrong was the best hockey player in the world.\\n\\n\\nRight.  I had to get to the end of your posting before I realized you were \\na complete joke.\\n\\nIn the future, if you are going to respond to my postings I would appreciate\\nit if you could present a cogent argument supported by facts gleaned from a\\nversion of reality that most of the rest of us would recognize.\\n\\ncordially, as always, \\n\\nrm\\n',\n",

       " \"\\nGee, you'd think Winnipeg would be tops on that list, what with 8 regulars\\nbeing European.\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, being a Jet fan, I sometimes wish that Bure would get knocked silly\\ntoo.  (Nothing serious, just enough to keep him out of a game. :)\\n\\n\\n\\nIn most cases, the owners have very little to do with it.  They give their\\ngeneral managers one order when it comes to the draft...find me the best\\nplayers so that our team will win the Stanley Cup.  Whether that player is\\nin Kindersley, Saskatchewan or Chelyabinsk, Russia, if the GM believes him\\nto be the better player, the GM should be drafting him.\\n\\nWhere do you get off calling the NHL THEIR league, when referring to Canadian\\nplayers.  It doesn't belong to them, it belongs to the owners.  The owners\\ncan do what they want.  While a 'Canadian content' rule might be enforcable\\nhere in Canada, there is enough doubt that it would be enforcable in the US\\nthat the CFL (sorry for the football reference) didn't even TRY to push their\\nimport ratio rule on the Sacromento Goldminers.\\n\\nIncreasing the competition for the 'elite' positions, in most cases, would\\nmake players better anyways.  (Oh yeah, and how many Europeans play at the\\nlower levels of professional hockey in North America?  While there are some\\nthat play in the AHL, or the IHL where that's an NHL team's primary farm\\nclub, you don't hear of many Europeans playing in the CHL, the ECHL, or on\\nthe secondary farm teams in the IHL.  (ie. the Jets do have a few Russian\\nplayers in Moncton, but I don't believe there are any Europeans in Ft. Wayne.))\\nSo with all those teams, there are plenty of positions for hockey players\\nin North America.\\n\\n\\nI'm in favour of the NHL being the league for the premier players in the\\nworld.

       " \"\\n\\tWell here is my $0.02 worth.  Advice from a grad student.\\n\\n\\tI agree with the gentlemen who wrote the comment before me.\\nThe important thing is pick what ever interest you the most and \\nlearn as much as possible about it.  \\n\\n\\tIn my five years of education in this field, though brief \\ncompare to alot of people, I had to think about this kind of \\nquestion a lot.  Did I make the right decision in going into\\nElectrical Engineering as opposed to Computer engineering or\\nCS?  The more I go thru school, the more I believe that this\\nkind of question is irrelevant.  \\n \\n\\tI have come to believe that choosing CS because one \\ndoes not like hardware or choosing hardware because one does\\nnot like to program is really doing an injustice of building\\nand computer and making it useful for something.  Everything\\nis interwoven and inseparable.  CS, CE, and EE are all a \\npart of a really great discipline and do depend on each other.\\n\\n\\tMy advice is don't limit yourself, but make a decision\\nbased on which major will give you the best opportunities to \\nlearn.  That of course depends on the curriculum at your \\npersective school.  I would choose a major that allows me to\\nexplore as much as possible.  Beside, I don't know why the\\nschool would make a student choose a major before her/his\\nsophamore year.                  \\n\\n\\tHey you may be so interested in this field that you \\ndecided to learn all about the making of computers in which \\ncase, you suffer a little more and go to grad school.\\n\\n\\tAbout the money.  Don't look at the averages, if you\\nare good, you are going to earn more money than anyone else. \\nIf you are a superstar programmer, you will earn millions.  \\nLike wise if you are a hotshot computer designers.        \",\n",
       " '\\n\\n\\tI think this kind of comparison is pretty useless in general.  The\\nprocessor is only good when a good computer is designed around it adn the\\ncomputer is used in its designed purpose.  Comparing processor speed is\\npretty dumb because all you have to do is just increase the clock speed\\nto increase speed among other things.\\n\\n\\tI mean how can you say a 040 is faster than a 486 without \\ngiving is operational conditions?  Can you say the same when \\nyou are running a program that uses a lot of transidental functions.\\nKnowing that 040 does not have transidental functions building in to \\nits FPU and 486 does, can you say that 040 is still faster?\\n\\n\\tAnyway, I hope people do not decided upon wether a computers\\nis good or not solely on its processor.  Or how fast a processor is\\nbased on its name, because one can alway do a certain things to a\\nprocessor to speed it up.  \\n\\n\\tBut if we restrict our arguements to, for example, pure\\nprocessor architectural issues.  Or how one processor will work\\nwell and another will not based on its design, then we can get\\nsomewhere with our discussions.  \\n\\n- Chung Yang',\n",

Technical issues are not terribly important at\\nthis point.  Well, my group\\'s plan is to market a \"full page\" monitor\\nfor laptop computers.  It would be a third-party product to be installed\\nby authorized repair centers (like Newer Technology\\'s PaletteBook\\nscreen).  The idea is that the screen would fold in such a way that you\\nwould get twice the screen height of a normal screen (remember,\\ntechnical issues aside!).  In fact, by adjusting the fold of the screen\\nand the monitor configuration, you could have regular OR \"full\" height. \\nThe screen would probably be monochrome.\\nThe motivation behind this is that laptop computers seem to be very\\npopular among business people.  Business people also commonly use word\\nprocessing and spreadsheet applications for which it is very convenient\\nto see a large portion of the document.  Because of the target users and\\napplications, color screens aren\\'t really a neccessity.  We could\\nhopefully keep the cost between $2000 and $3000.\\n\\nNow, please don\\'t write this off as completely ridiculous.  I really\\nneed some constructive feedback.
