    "A taxi driver is calculating their profit over two weeks by adding up the fares they charge and subtracting the cost of gas. The price of gas changes over time - it was `$3.52`/gallon the first week and `$3.57`/gallon this second week. Their car gets 20 miles per gallon.\n",

For the second week they had 17 passengers with average `$30` fare each, and drove a total of 220 miles. Assume that for both weeks they purchase all the gas needed during that week (i.e. they refuel every week to maintain a constant level of gas in the tank).\n",
